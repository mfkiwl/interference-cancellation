Instead of the widely-discussed conventional and/or subspace-based
multiuser signal model, we proposed a semiblind signal model and
framework in this paper. Following this framework with the minimum
variance unbiased estimation (MVU) and minimum mean squared error
(MMSE) estimation criteria, two new semiblind multiuser detectors
are developed for asynchronous CDMA channels. Furthermore, the
classic truncated-window scheme is generalized to a multi-window
scheme so that several consecutive bits can be simultanously
detected. The proposed algorithms are simple and direct. They
require only desired user's timing, amplitude and signature. No
prior knowledge, no search or estimation regarding other users is
involved as in many other semi-blind or blind detectors. A minimum
number of previously received signals are required for multiuser
detections. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are
finally presented to support the performance of the proposed
semi-blind multiuser detection schemes.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Multiuser detection strategy is a method for minimizing the effect
of multiple access interference (MAI) and solving the near-far
problem without a significant reduction in the signal energies of
the strong users in order for the weaker users to achieve reliable
communication. It has been extensively investigated over the past
several years~\cite{Verd98}, since MAI is the dominant impairment
for CDMA systems and exists even in perfect power-controlled CDMA
systems. Most multiuser detection schemes are based on the
conventional multiuser signal model and detect desired users' bits
using statistical signal estimation techniques with the minimum
bit-error rate (MBER)~\cite{Verd86,Verd89}, least-square (LS)
errors~\cite{Lupa89}, MMSE~\cite{Lupa89,Honi95} and/or minimum
output energy (MOE)~\cite{Honi95} criteria, ect.. In the
conventional signal model, received signals and most multiuser
receivers are represented by involved users' amplitudes, timing
and spreading signatures, which are difficult to be priorly known
by semiblind/blind receivers. On the other hand, the adaptive or
training procedure employed by many semiblind/blind multiuser
detectors normally costs receivers too much time or computation
resource. Recently, there are lots of discussions regarding
subspace-based signal model, where each received signal can be
taken as a linear combination of the bases of signal and noise
subspaces, and subspace-based multiuser
detectors~\cite{Yang95,Wang98,Wang99}, which essentially are
methods for blindly reconstruct existing conventional detectors.
Thought their performance can be well above many previous
semiblind/blind approaches, subspace-based multiuser detectors
need compute the covariance matrix of received signals and
separate signal/noise subspace bases. This makes it difficult to
be implemented in many practical situations, especially where the
wireless channel and/or the number of users experience fast
dynamic changes.

For solving these problems, we propose a semiblind multiuser
signal model and a simple multiuser detection framework, which
require only desired users' spreading sequence and amplitude and
previously received signals, for asynchronous CDMA channel. Based
on this framework, we develop two semiblind multiuser detectors
using MVU and MMSE criteria instead of the LS criterion discussed
in~\cite{Wang03d,Wang03e}. In the proposed signal model and
framework, each received asynchronous signal or semiblind receiver
is taken as a linear combination of the desired user's spreading
sequence, several previously received signals and noise.
Therefore, there is no converging, estimation or subspace
separation procedure employed. The proposed semiblind schemes are
simple and direct with a minimum number of previously received
signals required for multiuser detections. An adaptive
implementation is also presented to further reduce computation
complexity. Performance analysis and computer simulations are
finally presented to demonstrate their performance.

\section{Data Model and Problem Description}
At first, the conventional $K$-user asynchronous multiuser model
is presented~\cite{Verd98}. The baseband representation of the
received signal due to the $k$th user is given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r_k(t)&=&\sum\limits_{i=-\infty}^{+\infty}A_k b_k[i]
s_k(t-iT_c-\tau_k)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $b_k[i]$ is the $i$th bit sent by the $k$th user.
We assume that the $\left\{b_k[i]\right\}$ are independent and
identically distributed random variables with
$E\left\{b_k[i]\right\}=0$ and $E\left\{|b_k[i]|^2\right\}=1$. The
parameters $s_k(t)$ denote the normalized signal waveform of the
$k$th user during the interval $[(n-1)T,\ nT]$, $\tau_k$ denotes
the transmission delay from the $k$th user to the base station and
$A_k$ is the amplitude of the received signal of the $k$th user.
The baseband signal at the input of the receiver at the mobile
station is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r(t)&=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}r_k(t)+n(t)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n(t)$ is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
with power spectral density $\sigma_n^2$.

The received signal is synchronized for each user individually,
passed through the corresponding chip matched filter (CMF) and
sampled at the chip rate $1/T_c$. The vector of the output samples
of the CMF for $k$th user in the $n$th symbol interval can be
expressed as

\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.1in}
\begin{array}{l}
\br_k{[n]}=\left[
\matrix{r_k(nT+T_c+\tau_k)&\ldots&r_k(nT+LT_c+\tau_k)}\right]^{\rm
T}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

Prior to developing our semi-blind decorrelating detectors, we
first discuss the classic single-truncated-window decorrelating
detector, in which the system is assumed to be chip-synchronous
and the observation window is restricted to one symbol
interval~\cite{Verd98}. Without loss of generality, we consider
the detection of the first user while the other users' signals are
treated as interference. A typical interferer has two consecutive
symbols interfering with the symbol of user $1$ so that the
received signal $\br$ can be conventionally and straightforwardly
expressed by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.1in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br_1&\hspace{-0.1in}=&\hspace{-0.1in}A_1b_1{[n]}\bs_1+\sum\limits_{k=2}^{K}A_k\left\{b_k{[n-1]}
\bs_{k-}+b_k{[n]} \bs_{k+}\right\} + \bn\\
&\hspace{-0.1in}=&\hspace{-0.1in}\bS_1\bA_1\bb_1+\bn
\end{array} \label{r}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bs_{k-}$ and $\bs_{k+}$ are effective signature
sequences or partial signature sequences that are completely
determined by the spreading sequences $\bs_k$ and the delays
relative to the first user $\tau_{k1}=\tau_k-\tau_1$, $\bn$ is an
$L$-dimension Gaussian vector with independent
$\sigma_n^2$-variance components, $L \geq 2K-1$, and

\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.6in}
\begin{array}{l}
\bS_1=\left[\matrix{\bs_1&\bs_{2-}&\bs_{2+}&\ldots&\bs_{K-}&\bs_{K+}}\right]\\
\end{array},\label{S1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{l}
\bA_1=\mbox{diag}\left\{\matrix{A_1&A_2&A_2&\ldots&A_K&A_K}\right\}\\
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.1in}
\begin{array}{l}
\bb_1=\left[\matrix{b_1[n]&b_2[n-1]\ b_2[n]&\ldots&b_K[n-1]\
b_K[n]}\right]^{\rm T}.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The classic single-truncated-window decorrelating detector
actually performs the following operation

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_1&=&\mbox{sgn}\left\{\bS_1^{+}\br_1\right\}
\end{array}\label{single-window}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $[\cdot]^+$ denotes the generalized inverse. The
single-truncated-window decorrelating detector is designed to
completely eliminate MAI caused by other users, which is achieved
at the expense of enhancing the ambient noise. However, there are
some desirable features of this multiuser detector. It can readily
be decentralized in the sense that the demodulation of each user
can be implemented completely independently. It does not require
knowledge of the received amplitudes of all users but $\bS_1^+$,
which makes it hard to be directly implemented in many practical
situtations, and the delays of all users.

\section{Semi-blind Signal Model And Framework}
\begin{figure} \center{
\includegraphics[width=3in]{SBMUDstruct2.eps}
\caption{The proposed semiblind Multiuser detection model and
framework. } }\label{MUD_model}
\end{figure}
Though the conventional multiuser signal model in (\ref{r})
provides an accurate and straightforward description of the
received signal $\br$, it may be difficult to be directly used in
semiblind/blind multiuser detection since the unknown original
spreading sequences matrix is used. For example, convetional
decorrelating detectors, inclduing (\ref{single-window}), can
achieve optimum near-far resistance, least squares and maximum
likiehood without unknown amplitude but $\bS_1^{+}$ before
detection. Though conventional decorrelating detectors can be
developed into blind detectors using subspace
approach~\cite{Wang98}, the time and computation requirement for
the subspace separation operation are not trivial. For simplifying
the computation of semiblind/blind multiuser detections, we extend
the synchronous semiblind detection idea in~\cite{Wang03d,Wang03e}
and define a new asynchronous $PL\times M$ semi-blind signal
signature matrix $\bcS$ for user $1$, which can be written by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bcS&=&[\matrix{\bI_P \otimes (A_1\bs_1)&\bar{\br}_{1}&\bar{\br}_{2}&\ldots&\bar{\br}_{M-P}}]\\
 &=&\bS\bar\bA\bB + \bar{\bN}
\end{array} \label{S}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the $PL\times (PK+K-1)$ matrix
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bS&=&[\matrix{\bar{\bS}_1&\bar{\bS}_2&\bar{\bS}_3&\ldots&\bar{\bS}_K}]
\end{array} \label{S0}
\end{equation}

\noindent is a multi-window version of the original signature
matrix $\bS_1$ with

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\bS}_1&=&\mbox{diag}\{\matrix{\bs_1&\bs_1&\ldots&\bs_1}\}_{PL\times
P}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\bS}_k&=&\mbox{diag}\{\matrix{\bs_{k_-}&\bs_k&\ldots&\bs_k&\bs_{k_+}}\}_{PL\times
(P+1)}
\end{array},
\end{equation}

\noindent the $(PK+K-1)\times (PK+K-1)$ diagonal matrix
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar\bA&=&\mbox{diag}\{\matrix{\bar{\bA}_1&\bar{\bA}_2&\ldots&\bar{\bA}_K}\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent denotes a multi-window amplitude diagonal matrix with

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\bA}_1&=&\mbox{diag}\{\matrix{A_1&A_1&\ldots&A_1}\}_{P\times
P}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\bA}_k&=&\mbox{diag}\{\matrix{A_k&A_k&\ldots&A_k}\}_{(P+1)\times
(P+1)}
\end{array},
\end{equation}

\noindent $\bar{\br}_i$ are several previously received vectors of
length $P$ symbols,
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
 \bB &=&\left[\matrix{\bG \cr \matrix{\mathbf{0}& \tilde{\bD}}
 }\right]
 &=&\left[\matrix{\bI_P& \bar{\bD} \cr \mathbf{0}& \tilde{\bD}
 }\right],
\end{array}\label{B}
\end{equation}
with the $PL\times(M-P)$ multi-window bits matrix $\bD =
[\bar{\bD}^{\rm T}\ \tilde{\bD}^{\rm T}]^{\rm T}$, in which
$\bar{\bD}$ is a known $(M-P)\times P$ vector consisting of
previously detected bits for the desired user.
$\mbox{rank}\{\bB\}\leq PK+K-1$ and
$\mbox{rank}\{\tilde{\bD}\}\leq PK+K-P-1$. The $PL\times M$ matrix
$\bar{\bN}=[\mathbf{0}\ \tilde{\bN}]$ denotes the multi-window
noise matrix. $\otimes$ denotes the Kronecker product and we
maintain $PK+K-1\leq M\leq PL $. $M=PK+K-1$ is the minimum number
for indentifying $\bS$ from $\bcS$.

Using (\ref{r}) and (\ref{S}), the semiblind representation of the
current received signal vector $\br$, which is of length $P$
symbols, is given by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.2in}
\begin{array}{l}
\br=[\matrix{\br_1[n]^{\rm T}&\br_1[n-1]^{\rm T}&\ldots&\br_1[n-P+1]^{\rm T}}]^{\rm T}\\
\hspace{0.1in}=\bcS\bd + \bar{\bn} \label{rn}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the $M \times 1$ vector $\bd$ denotes the new
detection vector and is defined as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bd&=&\bB^+\bar\bb_1
\end{array} \label{DetectorVector}
\end{equation}

\noindent and $\bar{\bn}$ is the new noise vector and defined as
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\bn}&=&\bn-\bar{\bN}\bB^{+}\bar\bb_1
\end{array} \label{new_noise}
\end{equation}
\noindent With (\ref{B}) and (\ref{DetectorVector}), the bits
vector $\bar{\bb}$ which consists of $P$ bits sent by user 1 at
the consecutive symbol intervals $t=n-P+1$, $n-P+2$, $\ldots$, $n$
can be obtained by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\bb}_1&=& \bG\bd
\end{array}. \label{bn_estimation}
\end{equation}
\noindent The proposed semiblind detection framework can be
illustrated in Fig. 1.

\section{Semi-Blind Multiuser Detection}
After defining the known semi-blind signature matrix $\bcS$ in
(\ref{S}), the conventional signal model (\ref{r}) is transformed
into (\ref{rn}) with the desired bits vector $\bb$ replaced by the
detection vector $\bd$ and the original noise vector $\bn$ replace
by $\tilde{\bn}$. On the other hand, the desired bits vector $\bb$
can be detected using $\bd$, $\bG$ and (\ref{bn_estimation}). Now
the question is how to efficiently estimate $\bd$ in (\ref{rn}).
In~\cite{Wang03d,Wang03e}, three LS-based approaches were proposed
with different assumptions regarding the noise in $\bcS$. In the
following, we develop two new estimation schemes based on MUV and
MMSE criteria using some statistical information regarding $\bd$
and $\bar\bn$.

\subsection{Minimum Variance Unbiase Estimation}
The optimal estimator which constrains the biase to be zero and
minimizes the variance is termed MVU estimator. When MVU estimator
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bd}_{\rm MVU}&=&{\bf f}(\br)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
exists, it may be found that attains the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB) so that
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{\partial\ln Pr(\br;\ \bd)}{\partial\bd}&=&\bI(\bd)\left[{\bf
f}(\br)-\bd\right]
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\noindent where $Pr(\br;\ \bd)$ is the joint PDF of $\br$ and
$\bd$ and $\bI(\bd)$ is the Fisher information matrix (FIM)
defined by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.04in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
$\bI(\bd)$ &=& {\rm E} \left\{ \left( \frac{\partial \ln{Pr(\br;\
\bd)}}{\partial \bd} \right) \left( \frac{\partial \ln{Pr(\br;\
\bd)}}{\partial \bd} \right)^{\rm H} \right\}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Though the determination of the optimal MVU estimator is
generally a difficult, it can be evident with linear constriant.
The MVU estimator for $\bd$ then is~\cite{Key93}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm MVU}&=&(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\br\ .
\end{array} \label{BLUE}
\end{equation}
\noindent The covariance matrix of ${\bbf}_{\rm MVU}$ given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bC}_{\bd_{\rm MVU}}&=&(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\noindent Though the PDF of $\bB$ may be determined, the PDF of
$\bB^{+}$ is largely unknown. This makes it is hard to calculate
the closed-form solution of $\bC_{\bd}$ and $\bC_{\tilde{\bn}}$.
However, with Girko's Law, when $\alpha=(2K-2)/(M-1)$ is fixed,
$K$, $M$ $\rightarrow\infty$, the diagonal element of
$\frac{1}{M-1}\tilde{\bD}^+\tilde{\bb}\tilde{\bb}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm +T}$ may be approximated
by~\cite{Muller,Hanly90}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\lim\frac{1}{M-1}\left[\tilde{\bD}^+\tilde{\bb}\tilde{\bb}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm +T}\right]_{ii}^{-1}&=&1-\alpha
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\noindent So, $\bC_{\bd}$ can be decided by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bC_{\bd}&=&\left[\matrix{\frac{2M-2K}{M-2K+1}&\bzero^{\rm
T}\cr\bzero&\frac{1}{M-2K+1}\bI}\right]
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\noindent and
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bC_{\bar\bn}&=&\sigma^{2}\frac{2M-2K}{M-2K+1}\bI
\end{array}\label{noise_var_new}
\end{equation}
\noindent and the bit vector for user $1$ can be detected by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_1&=&\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm T}\br\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Minimum Mean Square Estimation}
Though the optimal Bayesian estimators are difficult to determine
in close form or too computationally intensive to implement in
general, they can be found under the jointly Gaussian assumption
and linear constrain. This class of MMSE estimators are
generically termed Wiener filter. Given measurements $\br$, the
MMSE estimator of $\bd$, ${\bd}_{\rm MMSE} = f( \br )$, minimizes
the mean-squared error $J_{\rm MMSE}=E\{||\bd-\hat{\bd}||_2^2\}$.
The function $f(\br)$ may be nonlinear or linear and its exact
structure is determined by minimizing $J_{\rm MSE}$. When $\bbf$
and $\br$ are jointly Gaussian, the linear estimator $\bW_{\rm
MMS}$ that minimizes the mean-sqared error is (Bayesian
Gauss-Markov Theorem)
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bd}_{\rm MMS}&=&(\bC_{\bbf}^{-1}+\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\br
\end{array} \label{MSE}
\end{equation}
\noindent and its performance is measured by the covariance matrix
of the error ${\bf\epsilon}=\bd-\hat{\bd}$ given by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bC_{\bf\epsilon}&=&\left(\bC_{\bd}^{-1}+\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS\right)^{-1}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\noindent The bit vector for user $1$ can be detected by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.05in}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_1=\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG(\bC_{\bbf}^{-1}+\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\br\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\section{Adaptive Implementation}
Following the well-known Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix inverse
lemma~\cite{Golu96}, an adaptive implementation of  the proposed
MVU semiblind detector can be expressed by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_1(n)&=&\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG(n)\bcC_{\cal
S}^{+}(n)\bcS^{\rm T}(n)\br(n)\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.1in}
\begin{array}{l}
\bcC_{\cal S}^{+}(n)=\bcC_{\cal S}^{+}(n-1)-\bigl[\bcC_{\cal
S}^{+}(n-1)\bU(n-1)\bU^{\rm T}(n-1)\\
\hspace{0.2in}\bcC_{\cal S}^{+}(n-1)\bigr]\left[\bI+\bU^{\rm
T}(n-1)\bcC_{\cal S}^{+}(n-1)\bU(n-1)\right]^{-1}
\end{array}\label{adaptiveLS}
\end{equation}
\noindent where
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bcC_{\cal S}(n)&=&\bcS(n)^{\rm T}\bcS(n)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
 \noindent and $\bU(n-1)$ is designed using SVD so that
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.00in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bU(n-1)\bU^{\rm T}(n-1)&=&\bcC_{\cal S}(n)-\bcC_{\cal S}(n-1)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Comparasion with The Classic Decorrelator}

When $P=1$, there is no noise in $\bcS$ and $\bG$ is accurately
known beforehand, there is the following relationship between the
user $1$'s BLU detector $\bw_{\rm BLU}$ and the decorrelator
$\bw_{\rm DD}$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\bw_{\rm BLU}&=&\bG(\bcS^{\rm T}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}&=&A_1^{-1}\bw_{\rm DD}
\end{array}
\end{equation} \label{wN0}

\noindent On the other hand, $\bw_{\rm DD}$ can be taken as a
special case of $\bw_{\rm BLU}$ with $\bB =\bI$ and $P=1$.

\subsection{The New Noise Vector $\tilde{\bn}$}

The mean of the semi-blind noise item $\tilde{\bn}$ in
(\ref{new_noise}) given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\tilde{\bm}&=&{\rm E}\{\tilde{\bn}\}&=&0
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent The variance of $\tilde{\bn}$ satisfies the following
inequation

\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{l}
\bigl|{\rm
E}\{(\tilde{\bn}-\tilde{\bm})^2\}\bigr|_{\infty}\leq\sigma_n^2+(P+1)(K-1)\|\tilde{\bD}^+\|_2^2\sigma_{\bar{n}}^2
\end{array} \label{noise_mean}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bigl|\star\bigr|_{\infty}$ denotes the infinity
norm of vector $\star$ and $\sigma_{\bar{n}}^2$ is the power of
the noise item $\bar{\bN}$ in the semi-blind signature matrix
$\bcS$.

\subsection{AME and Near-Far Resistance}
A commonly used performance measure for a multiuser detector is
asymptotic multiuser efficiency(AME) and near-far
resistance~\cite{Verd98}. Since the proposed algorithms converges
to the conventional adecorrelating detector as $\sigma\rightarrow
0$, their AME and near-far resistance for user 1 is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\bar{\eta}_1&=&\left[\bR^{+}\right]_{11}^{-1}&=&\left[(\bS^{\rm
T}\bS)^{+}\right]_{11}^{-1}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\subsection{CRLB for $\bd$ Estimation}
The CRLB is given by the inverse of the FIM. Providing the blind
spreading matrix $\bcS$ is known beforehand, we first define the
parameter vector $\mathbf{\phi} = \left[\bar{\sigma}^{2}\
\bbf^{\rm T}\right]^{\rm T}$, where $\bar{\sigma}^{2}
=(1+\frac{M-1}{M-2K+1})\sigma^{2}$, for computing the FIM, which
is defined by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bI(\mathbf{\phi}) &=& {\rm E} \left\{ \left( \frac{\partial
\ln{\rm Pr}}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}} \right) \left( \frac{\partial
\ln{\rm Pr}}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}} \right)^{\rm H} \right\}
\label{fim}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\ln{\rm Pr}$ is the log-likelihood function given
by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\ln{\rm
Pr}&=&C-L\ln\bar{\sigma}^2-\frac{1}{2\bar{\sigma}^2}\parallel\mathbf{e}\parallel_2^2
\end{array},\label{logl}
\end{equation}
\noindent $C$ is a constant and $\mathbf{e}=\br-\bcS\bbf$.
Providing $\bcS$ is known, the closed-form CRLB expression of
$\bbf$ is then given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\rm CRLB}(\bbf\ |\ \bcS) &
=&(1+\frac{M-1}{M-2K+1})\sigma^{2}(\bcS^{\rm T}\bcS)^{\rm +}
\end{array}.\label{CRLB_f}
\end{equation}
\noindent From (\ref{CRLB_f}), it shows that the accuracy of
estimating $\bbf$ may increase with increasing $M$.


\section{Computer Simulations}

In this section, various computer simulations and analytical
results are presented. In the computer simulations, two users are
sending the signals in asynchronous CDMA system. The spreading
gain $g=24$. the covariance matrix between these two users are
$\bR$.

\noindent and the channel is AWGN channel. We do the simulations
with $P=1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $7$ and $9$. Correspondingly, the
number of columns in the semi-blind signature matrix is
$M=(P+1)\times K-1$. We will compare our algorithms with
single-user matched filter (MF) detector and the
single-truncated-window decorrelating detector (DD).

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, a new and simple semiblind multiuser detection
framework and two semiblind detectors are proposed for
asynchronous CDMA. Compared with most existing semiblind/blind
multiuser detection schemes, the proposed schemes are simple and
direct without any estimation or subspace separation operation.
They require a minimum number of previously received signals, as
well as desired user's spreading sequence, timing and amplitude.
