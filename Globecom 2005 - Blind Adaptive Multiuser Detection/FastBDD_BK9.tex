In this paper, we propose a new blind multiuser detection model
and framework for CDMA forward links. Based on this blind
detection framework, several novel blind multiuser detection
algorithms are developed using least-squares-based (LS)
estimations, including LS estimation, total least-squares (TLS)
estimation and mixed LS/TLS (MLS) estimation, best least unbiased
(BLU) estimation, minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation
criteria. All proposed algorithms are simple and direct. Only the
spreading sequence and timing of the desired user(s) are involved.
No prior knowledge or estimation of other unknown users is
required. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are
finally provided to demonstrate the proposed schemes.

\section{Introduction}

Multiuser detection strategy is a method to minimize MAI effects
with exploiting interference structure. It has been extensively
investigated over the past several years since MAI is the dominant
impairment for CDMA systems and even exists in perfect
power-controlled CDMA systems~\cite{Verd98}. Recent research has
been devoted to blind multiuser detection and subspace-based
signature waveform estimation schemes for achieving better
performance and higher
capacity~\cite{Madh94,Honi95,Poor97,Wang98,Torl97,Liu96}. Blind
multiuser detectors can achieve good performance with only the
knowledge of the timing and signature waveform of desired user(s)
while they don't require intensive computation, compared with
optimal multiuser detectors and some conventional multiuser
detectors. There are two popular approaches for designing blind
multiuser detectors. One is to use statistic optimization
criteria, e.g. MMSE~\cite{Madh94,Honi95}, for blind multiuser
detection. The other approach is to estimate and restore the
conventional system model and therefore use conventional multiuser
detection techniques. Many subspace-based approaches are the
examples using this approach~\cite{Yang95,Wang98,Poor98,Wang99}.

Various multiuser detection schemes have been developed to
mitigate MAI effects. The assumption for blind detection design
obviously is much closer to practical applications. So far, most
blind detectors are based on the conventional multiuser system
model which is intensively discussed in~\cite{Verd98}. In this
paper, we proposed an alternative approach for forward-link blind
multiuser receiver design. Instead of using the conventional
multiuser system model, a new blind multiuser system model is
constructed for each individual receiver. Different to the
conventional model including all users' amplitude and spreading
sequence information, the proposed blind model only contains the
desired users' spreading sequences and several previous received
signal vectors. Instead of the original spreading sequence matrix,
a blind spreading sequence matrix, which is different for
different users and can even change from time to time, is used in
the blind model. Based on this blind system model, a blind
multiuser detection framework and therefore several blind
multiuser detectors using LS-based estimations, BLU estimation and
MMSE estimation are proposed. In the present multiuser blind
detectors, only the signature and timing of the desired user are
utilized. These algorithms are simple and direct. No search
procedure is employed as many other semi-blind/blind
detectors~\cite{Torl97,Wang98}. Theoretical analysis and computer
simulations are finally presented to demonstrate the performance
of these blind detectors.

\section{Conventional System Model And Problem Description}

We consider forward-link transmissions in a single-cell DS/CDMA
system. There are $K$ active users over the multipath channel with
$P$ strong paths~\footnote{Strong paths are those paths which will
be explicitly combined by RAKE receiver.} and the channel is an
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The baseband
representation of the received signal due to user $k$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r_k(t)&=&\sum\limits_{p=1}^{P}A_k[n] b_k[n]s_k(t-nT-\tau_p)
\end{array}
\end{equation}


\noindent where $b_k{[n]}$ is the $n$th bit sent by user $k$. We
assume that the $\left\{b_k{[n]}\right\}$ are independent and
identically distributed random variables with
$E\left\{b_k{[i]}\right\}=0$ and $E\left\{|b_k{[i]}|^2\right\}=1$.
The parameters $s_k(t)$ denote the normalized spreading signal
waveform of user $k$ during the interval $[0,\ T]$,
$\tau_1\leq\tau_2\leq\ldots\leq\tau_P$, denotes $P$ different
transmission delay from the base station to user $k$ and $A_k[n]$
is the amplitude of the received signal for user $k$ at time
$t=n$. The total baseband signal received by user $k$ is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\tilde{r}(t)&=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}r_k(t)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The received signal $\tilde{r}(t)$ is passed through the
corresponding chip matched filter (CMF) and RAKE combiner. The
output is

\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{l}
r(t)=r_k(t-\tau_{1}) + m_{\rm ISI}(t) + m_{\rm MAI}(t) + n(t)
\end{array}\label{r_t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
 m_{\rm ISI}(t)&=&\sum\limits^{p\neq
q}_{1<p,q<P}\alpha_{p}r_k(t+\tau_{q1}-\tau_p)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent is the intersymbol interference (ISI) to user $k$,


\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
 \hspace{-0.1in}m_{\rm MAI}(t)=\\
 \sum\limits_{i=1, i\neq
 k}^{K}\left\{r_i(t-\tau_{1})+\sum\limits_{p\neq
q}^{P}\alpha_{p}r_i(t+\tau_{q1}-\tau_p)\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent is the MAI to user $k$, $\alpha_q$ is the weight of the
$q$th RAKE finger with $\sum\limits_{q=1}^{P}\alpha_q=1$ and
$\tau_{p1} = \tau_{p}-\tau_1$ is the propagation delay difference
between the $1$st path and $p$th path. $n(t)$ is AWGN with power
spectral density $\sigma_n^2$. The user $k$'s RAKE output can be
sampled at $f_s=1/T_s$ and expressed by~\footnote{Without loss of
the generality, we drop the time index $n$ in the following
discussion.}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br&\hspace{-0.1in}=&\hspace{-0.1in}\left[
\matrix{r(nT+T_s+\tau_1)&\ldots&r(nT+LT_s+\tau_1)}\right]^{\rm
T}\\
 &\hspace{-0.1in}=&\hspace{-0.1in}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} A_k b_k \bs_k + \bn \\
 &\hspace{-0.1in}=&\hspace{-0.1in}\bS \bA \bb + \bn
\end{array}\label{r_sync}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $L=T/T_s$ is the number of samples per symbol and
is not less than the spreading gain $L_c$.

Because of $m_{\rm MAI}(t)$ existing in the received signal
$r(t)$, the performance of conventional matched filter receiver
will suffer from so-call near-far problem where a strong or
near-by user can prevent the detection of weak or far-away users.
Multiuser detection is the receiver technique for solving the
near-far problem. Instead of assuming the knowledge of the
spreading codes or channel parameters of all users that contribute
to the received signals for cancelling MAI in conventional
multiuser detection schemes, it assumes that each mobile station
has only knowledge of the received spreading waveform for its own
channel and maybe several other shared channels in blind multiuser
detection so that blind multiuser detection is more closed to
practical applications. Linear blind multiuser detector was
proposed by Shnidman~\cite{Shni67}. Compared with other
centralized schemes, linear blind multiuser detector can be
implemented in a decentralized fashion where only the user or
users of interest need be demodulated and therefor is much closed
to practical applications. Most linear multiuser detectors for
demodulating the $k$th user's data bit in (\ref{r_sync}) is in the
form of a correlator followed by a hard limiter, which could be
expressed as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{b}_k &=& \mbox{sign}\{\bw_k^{\rm T}\br\}
\end{array} \label{linear}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bw_k \in \mathbb{R}^{L_s\times 1}$ is the linear
representation of multiuser detector.

\section{New Blind Multiuser Detection Framework\label{BMUD_model}}

Though most blind multiuser detectors are developed to operate
without prior knowledge regarding other users, they use statistic
signal processing techniques to estimate other users' information
or to reconstruct signal subspace or even the conventional signal
model. Instead of doing these, we take a different approach for
blind multiuser detection. We propose a new blind multiuser system
model using a blind but "faked" spreading matrix for the desired
user(s). We say it is a blind but "faked" because 1) it consists
only of several known spreading sequence and also several previous
received signal vectors, 2) it isn't the original spreading
sequence matrix but works like the original one. Without loss of
the generality, only the bits $b_1$ sent by the first user in a
synchronous CDMA system are considered in the following
discussion. We show that the desired user's information bits can
be detected based on this blind multiuser system model.

The $L\times M$ blind spreading sequence matrix $\bcS$ for user
$1$ is defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bcS&=&[\matrix{\bar{\bs}_1&\bar{\bs}_2&\bar{\bs}_3&\ldots&\bar{\bs}_M}]\\
 &=&[\matrix{\bs_1&\ldots&\bs_G&{\br}_{1}&{\br}_{2}&\ldots&{\br}_{M-G}}]\\
 &=&\bS\bB + {\bN}
\end{array} \label{S_0}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bs_g$, $g=1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ G$, denote $G$
already known received spreading waveforms by the first user.
${\br}_m$, $m=1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ M-G$, are $M-G$ previously received
independent signal vectors,

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
 \bB&=&\left[\matrix{\bE & \bD }\right]
  &=&\left[\matrix{\bG \cr \matrix{\mathbf{0}& \tilde{\bD}}
 }\right]
\end{array}\label{B}
\end{equation}

\noindent is the $K\times M$ data matrix associated with $\bcS$.
$\bG = \left[\matrix{\bI& \bD}\right]$ is the $G\times M$ matrix
composed by known data in $\bcS$. $\mbox{rank}\{\tilde{\bD}\}=K-G$
and $\mbox{rank}\{\bB\}\geq K$. Combining (\ref{r_sync}) and
(\ref{S_0}), the received signal vector $\br$ in (\ref{r_sync})
can now be expressed by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br&=&\bcS\bbf + \bar{\bn} \label{r_blind}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the $M \times 1$ vector $\bbf$ is termed the
detection vector defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bbf&=&\bB^{+}\bar\bb
\end{array} \label{DetectorVector}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $[\cdot]^{+} $ denotes the Moore-Penrose matrix
inverse operation and $\bar\bb=\bA \bb$. $\bar{\bn}$ is the new
$L\times 1$ noise vector defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\bn}&=&\bn-{\bN}\bB^{+}\bar\bb
\end{array} \label{new_noise}
\end{equation}

Now, the conventional multiuser detection model (\ref{r_sync}) can
be replaced by (\ref{r_blind}) with $\bA\bb$ being replaced by the
detection vector $\bbf$ defined in (\ref{DetectorVector}) and the
original AWGN vector $\bn$ being replaced by $\bar{\bn}$ defined
in (\ref{new_noise}). Fortunately, the bit $b_1$ sent for user 1
can still be detected using the detection vector $\bbf$ and the
known matrix $\bG$. This can be shown in Fig.~\ref{MUDstruct} and
expressed by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_1 &=& \left[\matrix{\hat{b}_1&\hat{b}_2&\ldots&\hat{b}_G}\right]^{\rm T}\\
&=&\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG\bbf\right\}\
\end{array} \label{b_estimation}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\ba}_1 &=&\left[\matrix{\hat{A}_1&\hat{A}_2&\ldots&\hat{A}_G}\right]^{\rm T} \\
&=&\left|\bG\bbf\right|\ .
\end{array} \label{A_estimation}
\end{equation}


\noindent The multiuser detection question for user $1$ now
becomes how to efficiently estimate $\bbf$ and construct $\bcS$.

\section{Blind Multiuser Detectors\label{LBD}}

From Fig.~\ref{MUDstruct}, we can see that the performance of this
blind multiuser detection frame work depends on the estimation of
$\bbf$ and the accuracy of $\bG$. The estimation of $\bbf$ is a
typical linear estimation problem. In the following, we discuss
various algorithms for estimating $\bbf$ with different criteria
such as LS, BLU, MMSE estimation and then formulate different
blind multiuser detectors.

\subsection{Least Squares Detection } At first, we assume that
the measurements of $\bcS$ are assumed to be free of error. All
errors are confined to the received vector $\br$. Hence, the
detection vector can be estimated with solving the following
equation

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm
LS}&=&\matrix{\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bx}\left\|\br-\bcS\bx\right\|_2}\\
&=&\bcS^+\br\\
&=&\bbf + \bcS^+\bar{\bn}
\end{array}
\label{LSProb}
\end{equation}

\noindent and the bit vector for user $1$ can be detected by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_1&=&\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG\bcS^{+}\br\right\}
\end{array} \label{w_LS}
\end{equation}



\subsection{Total Least Squares Detection}

It assume $\bcS$ to be error-free in the previous LS estimation.
This assumption is not entirely accurate according to the
definition in (\ref{S_0}) since there is a noise term $\bN$.
Problem (\ref{LSProb}) can then be transformed into the TLS
problem:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\left[\matrix{\bcS_{\rm TLS}\cr\bbf_{\rm
TLS}}\right]=\matrix{\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bar{\bcS},\
\bx}\left\|\left[ \matrix{\bcS\cr\br} \right] - \left[
\matrix{\bar{\bcS}\cr\bar{\bcS}\bx}\right]\right\|_2}
\end{array}.
\label{TLSProb}
\end{equation}

 Let $\bcS=\bU^{'}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{'}\bV^{'\rm T}$ and
$[\bcS\ \br]=\bU\mathbf{\Sigma}\bV^{\rm T}$ be the SVD of $\bcS$
and $[\bcS\ \br]$, respectively. If $\sigma_K^{'}
> \sigma_{K+1}$, TLS estimation of $\bbf$ then is
\begin{equation}
\bbf_{\rm TLS} = \left(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bcS-\sigma_{K+1}^2\bI\right)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm T}\br
\end{equation}
\noindent and the bit vector for user $1$ can be detected by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_1&=&\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bcS-\sigma_{K+1}^2\bI)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm T}\br\right\}
\end{array} \label{w_LS}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Mixed LS/TLS Detection}

Though there exists a noise or error matrix $\bN$ in $\bcS$ from
(\ref{S_0}), its first $G$ columns are exactly known to be
noise-free or error-free. Hence, to maximize the estimation
accuracy of the detection vector $\bbf$, it is natural to require
the corresponding columns of $\bcS$ to be unperturbed since they
are known exactly. Problem (\ref{LSProb}) or (\ref{TLSProb}) can
then be transformed into the following MLS problem:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\left[\matrix{\bcS_{\rm MLS}\cr\bbf_{\rm
MLS}}\right]=\matrix{\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bar{\bcS},\
\bx}\left\|\left[\matrix{\tilde{\bcS}\cr\br}\right]-\left[\matrix{\bar{\bcS}\cr[\bs_1\
 \bar{\bcS}]\bx}\right]\right\|_{2} }
\end{array}.\label{MLSProb}
\end{equation}

Consider the MLS problem in (\ref{MLSProb}) and perform the
Householder transformation $\bQ$ on the matrix
$[\matrix{\bcS&\br}]$ so that
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\bQ^{\rm
T}[\matrix{\bs_1&\ldots&\bs_G&\bar{\bcS}&\br}]=\left[\matrix{\bR_{11}&\bR_{12}&\br_{1r}\cr
\mathbf{0}&\bR_{22}&\br_{2r}}\right]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\bR_{11}$ is a $G\times G$ up triangle matrix, $\br_{1r}$
is a $G\times 1$ vector and $\br_{2r}$ is a $(L-G)\times 1$
vector. Denote $\sigma'$ as the smallest singular value of
$\bR_{22}$ and $\sigma$ as the smallest singular value of
$[\matrix{\bR_{22}&\br_{2r}}]$. If $\sigma'>\sigma$, then the MLS
solution uniquely exists and is given by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.06in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bbf_{\rm MLS}&=&\left(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bcS-\sigma^2\left[\matrix{0&\mathbf{0}\cr\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{I}_{M-1}}\right]\right)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\br
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\noindent and the bit vector for user $1$ can be detected by

\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.2in}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_1=\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG\left(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bcS-\sigma^2\left[\matrix{0&\mathbf{0}\cr\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{I}_{M-1}}\right]\right)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\br\right\}
\end{array} \label{b_MLS}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Best Linear Unbiased Detection}

We assume the linear structure

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm BLU}&=&\bW_{\rm BLU}^{\rm T}\br
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent for this so-called best linear unbiased estimator
(BLUE). Matrix $\bW_{\rm BLU}$ is designed such that: 1) $\bcS$
must be deterministic, 2) $\bar{\bn}$ must be zero mean with
positive definite known covariance matrix $\bC_{\bar{\bn}}$, 3)
${\bbf}_{\rm BLU}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\bbf$, 4) and the
error variance for each of the $M$ parameters is minimized as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bW_{\rm BLU}&=&\min\limits_{\bW_{\bbf}}
\mbox{var}\left\{\bW_{\bbf}^{\rm T}\br\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent In this way, ${\bbf}_{\rm BLU}$ will be unbiased and
efficient, within the class of linear estimators, by design. The
resulting best linear unbiased estimator is (Gauss-Markov
Theorem):

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm BLU}&=&(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\br\ .
\end{array} \label{BLUE}
\end{equation}

\noindent The covariance matrix of ${\bbf}_{\rm BLU}$ given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bC}_{\bbf_{\rm BLU}}&=&(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Since the above data are of Gaussian distributions, the
BLUE in (\ref{BLUE}) is also the minimum variance unbiased
estimation.  $\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}$ can be decided by $\sigma^2$
and $\bC_{\bbf}$. Let us consider $\bC_{\bbf}$ first. Though the
PDF of $\bB$ may be determined, the PDF of $\bB^{+}$ is largely
unknown. This makes it is hard to calculate the closed-form
solution of $\bC_{\bbf}$ and $\bC_{\tilde{\bn}}$. However, with
Girko's Law, when $\alpha=(K-G)/(M-G)$ is fixed, $K$, $M$
$\rightarrow\infty$, the diagonal element of
$\frac{1}{M-G}\tilde{\bD}^+\tilde{\bb}\tilde{\bb}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm +T}$ may be approximated
by~\cite{Muller,Hanly90}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\lim\frac{1}{M-G}\left[\tilde{\bD}^+\tilde{\bb}\tilde{\bb}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm +T}\right]_{ii}^{-1}&=&1-\alpha
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\noindent So, $\bC_{\bbf}$ can be decided by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bC_{\bbf}&=&\left[\matrix{\frac{2M-K-G}{M-K}\bA_1^2&\bzero^{\rm
T}\cr\bzero&\frac{1}{M-K}\bI}\right]
\end{array},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bA_1=\mbox{diag}\{\ba_1\}$, and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bC_{\bar\bn}&=&\sigma^{2}\frac{2M-K-G}{M-K}\bI
\end{array}\label{noise_var_new}
\end{equation}

\noindent and the bit vector for user $1$ can be detected by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_1&=&\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm T}\br\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}



\subsection{Minimum Mean Square Detection}
Now we estimate $\bbf$ based on MMSE criterion. This class of
estimators are generically termed Wiener filter. Given
measurements $\br$, the MSE estimator of $\bbf$, ${\bbf}_{\rm MS}
= f( \br )$, minimizes the mean-squared error $J_{\rm
MSE}=E\{||\bbf-\hat{\bbf}||_2^2\}$. The function $f(\br)$ may be
nonlinear or linear and its exact structure is determined by
minimizing $J_{\rm MSE}$. When $\bbf$ and $\br$ are jointly
Gaussian, the linear estimator $\bW_{\rm MMS}$ that minimizes the
mean-sqared error is (Bayesian Gauss-Markov Theorem)

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm MMS}&=&(\bC_{\bbf}^{-1}+\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\br
\end{array} \label{MSE}
\end{equation}

\noindent and the bit vector for user $1$ can be detected by

\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.05in}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_1=\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG(\bC_{\bbf}^{-1}+\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\br\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\section{ Adaptive Blind Multiuser Detection}

\end{figure}

With the proposed blind multiuser detection framework expressed in
(\ref{b_estimation}) and (\ref{A_estimation}), the two key
components are the detection vector $\bbf$ and the detected data
matrix $\bG$ or $\bD$. The accuracy of estimating $\bbf$ and $\bG$
obviously determines the performance of detecting $\hat{b}_1$. It
is necessary to look for an efficient adaptive mechanism for
continuously updating $\hat{\bbf}$ and $\hat{\bG}$, especially
when the channel is experiencing various fading. One of the
possible adaptive structures is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{AMUDstruct}. We can see that the updating of
$\hat{\bbf}$ and $\hat{\bG}$ is actually determined by how to
construct $\bcS$ and estimate $\bA_1$. The first part of this
question highly depends on the second part that actually sounds
like a general equalization problem. Therefore, we can use a
selective scheme for constructing $\bcS$. It means, if we can
pretty be sure how accurate each $\bA_1\bb_1$ estimation is, we
can update the next $\bcS$ only with the $\br$ corresponding to a
good $\bA_1\bb_1$ estimate. For $\bA_1$ estimation, the popular
adaptive signal estimation schemes, such as LMS and RLS, can be
easily applicable here.

Initial setup is important for blind detection or estimation
schemes. There are normally two popular approaches. One is to use
a explicit pilot/training channel which can help blind receiver
achieve fast and accurate convergence. The another approach is a
completely blind approach where the receiver will take care of all
necessary estimations. This approach will normally take more time
or steps than the previous one.

\section{Performance Analysis}

The Cram\'{e}r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is given by the inverse of
the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Providing the blind spreading
matrix $\bcS$ is known beforehand, we first define the parameter
vector $\mathbf{\phi} = \left[\bar{\sigma}^{2}\ \bbf^{\rm
T}\right]^{\rm T}$, where $\bar{\sigma}^{2}
=(1+\frac{M-G}{M-K})\sigma^{2}$ is the variance of elements in
$\bar\bn$, for computing the FIM, which is defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\rm FIM}&=&{\rm CRLB}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{\phi}\ |\ \bcS\right)\\
&=& {\rm E} \left\{ \left( \frac{\partial \ln{\cal L}}{\partial
\mathbf{\phi}} \right) \left( \frac{\partial \ln{\cal L}}{\partial
\mathbf{\phi}} \right)^{\rm H} \right\} \label{fim}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\ln{\cal L}$ is the log-likelihood function given
by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\ln{\cal
L}&=&C-L\ln\bar{\sigma}^2-\frac{1}{2\bar{\sigma}^2}\parallel\mathbf{e}\parallel_2^2
\end{array}\label{logl}
\end{equation}

\noindent and $C$ is a constant and $\mathbf{e}=\br-\bcS\bbf$.
Proving $\bcS$ is known, the closed-form CRLB expression of $\bbf$
is then given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\rm CRLB}(\bbf\ |\ \bcS) &
=&(1+\frac{M-G}{M-K})\sigma^{2}(\bcS^{\rm T}\bcS)^{\rm +}
\end{array}.\label{CRLB_f}
\end{equation}

\noindent From (\ref{CRLB_f}), it shows that the lower bound of
$\bbf$ estimation decreases with increasing $M$. Hence, we expect
the a better performance with a larger blind spreading sequence
matrix $\bcS$ though the computation complexity increases.


\section{Computer Simulations}

The spreading sequences used in simulations are $64$-chip, $L=64$,
random sequences and there are $K=10$ active users. The group size
$G=3$ and the blind spreading matrix size $M=63$. We directly use
the previously estimated amplitude $\hat{A}$ without any amplitude
filtering. From Fig.~\ref{BER_SNR}, it is interesting to see that
the performance of the simplest LS detector has the best
performance. We the check the performance of all proposed blind
detectors against the amplitude estimation errors. It shows that
the performance of the LS detector is the best, which is shown in
Fig.~\ref{BER_A_SNR}, while the performance of the other proposed
detectors is nearly unacceptable. From Fig.~\ref{BER_A_SNR}, we
can see that the BER of the LS detector basically is unchanged
against amplitude estimation error when SNR is large enough. From
Fig.~\ref{BER_M_SNR}, we can see that the performance of the LS
detector can be better providing $M$ is larger enough. This
confirms (\ref{noise_var_new}), which shows that the variance of
$\bar{\bn}$ decrease with increasing $M$.

\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we proposed an alternative approach for designing
blind multiuser detectors. The proposed blind multiuser detectors
are straightforward without any channel or spreading sequence
estimations employed by other existing blind detectors.
