% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.

  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}\small
Interference cancellation is one major multiuser detection
strategy for suppressing interference effects and improving system
performance. In this paper, a novel blind decision-feedback
interference cancellation framework and its implementations with
least squares, maximum likelihood and minimum mean squared error
criteria are proposed and analyzed. Compared with existing blind
multiuser receivers, the proposed framework and schemes require a
small number of previous received signals and no subspace
separation or sequence estimation. The detection complexity and
delay can therefore be low. The proposed schemes can also be
implemented in an adaptive fashion. Theoretical analysis as well
as computer simulations is provided to demonstrate the performance
of the proposed schemes.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Interference cancellation (IC) is the strategy for forming an
estimate of incurred interference, like intersymbol interference
(ISI), co-channel interference (CCI), adjacent channel
interference (ACI), etc., and subtracting it from received signals
before detection. Though it has intensively been investigated over
the last decades, its commercial applications for mitigating
multiuser access interference (MAI) in mobile network can only be
found in the last serval years~\cite{Andr05}. Several IC schemes,
such as successive IC and subspace-based IC, have been reported to
be implemented for 3G mobile network like cdma2000 and
WCDMA~\cite{Wang06A}. The recent standardizing Femto cell further
brought more interests and potential applications of IC
techniques~\cite{Air07}. Compared with other detection strategies,
IC focuses more on interference estimation. And different
interference estimation methods may lead to different IC
schemes~\cite{Verd98,Wang02b}, e.g. successive IC, multistage
detection, decision-feedback IC (DFIC)~\cite{Kave85,Duel95}, etc.
DFIC, including minimum mean squared error (MMSE)
DFIC~\cite{Kave85} and decorrelating DFIC~\cite{Duel95}, belongs
to the decision-driven schemes that combines features of
successive IC and multistage detection~\cite{Verd98}. Conventional
IC receivers are known to be able to solve the near-far problem
with the knowledge of the signature information of all
users~\cite{Verd98}. However this assumption isn't consistent with
many practical situations where the receiver may only know the
signatures of the expected signals not interfering signals. Recent
research has been devoted to semiblind/blind implementation of IC
as well as other multiuser
detectors~\cite{Madh94,Wang98,Zhang02,Wang03d,Wang05A} for the
practical applications where only information of desired/known
user(s) is available. In existing semiblind/blind implementations,
adaptive filter techniques, e.g., Wiener filtering~\cite{Madh94},
Kalman filtering~\cite{Zhang02} and subspace-based
implementations~\cite{Wang98}, are among the popular choices.

Decision-feedback techniques, including decision-feedback channel
equalization and signal detection, have intensively been discussed
since 1960s. In single-user decision-feedback equalization (DFE),
previous decision outputs are feeded back for estimating ISI and
detecting the next symbol. DFE is known to have the complexity
similar to linear equalization while the performance is close to
maximum likelihood equalization. In multiuser DFIC, both current
and previously received symbols and decision outputs are utilized
for detecting desired user(s)'s data~\cite{Verd98}. In
conventional DFIC~\cite{Verd98}, other users' current decision
outputs as well as their signal signatures are usually used for
estimating interference and detecting desired information. In
blind DFIC, only received signals and detection outputs of the
desired user(s) are available for separating signal subspaces and
adapting receiver for better interference
estimation~\cite{Wang98}. The challenge with existing DFIC
receiver design is that neither subspace separation nor receiver
adapting procedure is simple and fast enough, especially for
fast-fading channels~\cite{Madh94,Wang98,Zhang02}.

Conventional multiuser receivers as well as the blind IC receiver
with a large number of previously received symbols have been
intensively investigated. However, the performance of blind
interference cancellation receiver with limited previous knowledge
is largely unknown. In order to solve the near-far problem with
less prior knowledge, computation complexity and
delay~\cite{Wang03d,Wang05A}, we provide an alternative blind DFIC
multiuser receiver design framework, in which only a small amount
of previous symbols are necessary for estimating interference and
detecting next symbols in addition to desired user(s)' signatures
and timing. The trick is, instead of signal signature estimation
or signal subspace separation, previous symbols are directly taken
as the signal space bases, termed {\em blind signal signatures},
for separating interference from received signals. Thereafter,
with different signal estimation criteria including least squares
(LS), maximum likelihood (ML) and MMSE, several blind interference
cancellers are constructed. It is shown that the proposed
framework can be implemented in a adaptive and iterative fashion
so that the incurred complexity and detection delay can be further
reduced. These make it an attractive framework candidate to design
blind interference cancellation receivers for high data rate
applications. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are
also presented to demonstrate the performance of these blind
detectors. The proposed framework and schemes can easily be
extended for asynchronous CDMA too when a truncated-window model
is applied~\cite{Verd98}.
\section{System Model And Problem Description}
The synchronous transmission in a single-cell DS/CDMA system with
$K$ active users is discussed here. The channel is a multiplath
channel with $P$ strong paths~\footnote{Strong paths are those to
be explicitly combined by a RAKE receiver.} corrupted by additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The baseband representation of the
received signal due to user $k$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}\hspace{-0.2in}
r_k(t)=\sum\limits_{p=1}^{P}\alpha_{pk}A_k[n]
b_k[n]c_k(t-nT-\tau_p)+n_k(t)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\alpha_{pk}$ is the $p$th path loss of user $k$'s
signal, $b_k{[n]}$ is the $n$th bit sent by user $k$. We assume
that the $\left\{b_k{[n]}\right\}$ are independent and identically
distributed random variables with $E\left\{b_k{[i]}\right\}=0$ and
$E\left\{|b_k{[i]}|^2\right\}=1$. The parameters $c_k(t)$ denote
the normalized spreading signal waveform of user $k$ during the
interval $[0,\ T]$, $0\leq\tau_1\leq\tau_2\leq\ldots\leq\tau_P$,
denotes $P$ different transmission delays from the base station to
user $k$ and $A_k[n]$ is the received signal amplitude for user
$k$ at time $t=nT$, which depends on the possible channel
statistics. The total baseband signal received by user $k$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\tilde{r}(t)&=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}r_k(t)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
The received signal $\tilde{r}(t)$ is passed through the
corresponding chip matched filter (CMF), $\phi(t)$, and RAKE
combiner. The combined output $r(t)$ is~\footnote{We drop the time
index $n$ when it refers to the current signal.}

\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent and $\tau_{q1} = \tau_{q}-\tau_1$ is the propagation
delay difference between the $1$st path and $p$th path. $\otimes$
denotes the convolutional product. $n(t)\in{\bcN}\left(0,\
\sigma^{2}\right)$. Furthermore, the user $k$'s RAKE output can be

\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bS=\left[\bs_1\ \bs_2\ \ldots\ \bs_K\right]$ is
the actual spreading sequence matrix containing both ISI and MAI
and $L=\frac{T}{T_s}\leq L_{c}$ is the number of samples per
symbol. Because of the existing of $m_{\mbox{\rm\tiny MAI}}(t)$,
conventional matched filter receiver suffers from the so-called
near-far problem and IC is one of the receiver techniques for
solving this problem~\cite{Verd98}. However, most existing IC
receivers are designed with the assumption that either the
knowledge of the signature information of all user or a large
number of previously received signals is available. In following
sections, a novel blind IC framework and its implementations are
presented.
\section{Blind DFIC Framework}
Without loss of the generality, the signals for the first $G$
desired users will be detected with the assumption
$\bS_1=\left[\matrix{\bs_1&\bs_2&\ldots&\bs_G}\right]$ is known
beforehand. With (\ref{r_sync}) and $\bb=\left[\bb_{1}^{\rm H}\
\bb_{2}^{\rm H}\right]^{\rm T}$, $\bb_{1}=\left[b_{1}\ \cdots\
b_{G}\right]^{\rm H}$ is the data vector we want to detect and
$\bb_{2}=\left[b_{G+1}\ \cdots\ b_{K}\right]^{\rm T}$ is the data
vector embedded in interference. For estimating the MAI to the
first $G$ users, we assemble $M$ previously detected signal
symbols $\left\{\br[n-m]:\ 1\leq m\leq M\right\}$ into
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bcS&=&\bigl[\matrix{{\br}[n-1]&{\br}[n-2]&\ldots&{\br}[n-M]}\bigr]\\
&=&\bS_1\bA_1\bB_1+\bS_2\bA_2\bB_2+\bN\\
&=&\bS\bA\bB+\bN
\end{array} \label{bcs}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bB$ is the data matrix for $\bcS$
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bB&=&\left[\matrix{\bB_1\cr\bB_2}\right]
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\noindent with $\bA_1$, $\bA_2$, $\bB_1$ and $\bB_2$ the amplitude
matrices and data matrices for desired users and interfering
users, respectively, $\bS_2$ is the original interfering signals'
signatures, and $\bN$ is a Guassian matrix. Obviously the minimum
number of received signals a receiver requires for unambiguously
identifying the $\left(K-G\right)$ interfering users is $M\geq{\rm
rank}\left(\bB_2\right)=K-G$. With (\ref{bcs}), the interference
subspace can be approximated by
$\bar\mathbb{S}_{1}=\mbox{span}\left\{\bs_m | m=G+1,\ \ldots\
K\right\}\approx\mbox{span}\left\{\bcS-\bS_1\bA_1\bB_1\right\}$.
The MAI can be denoted by
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bm &=&\bS_2\bA_2\bb_2\\
&=&\bigl(\bcS-\bS_1\bA_1\bB_1-\bN\bigr)\bB_2^{+}\bb_2\\
&=&\bcS\bbf-\bS_1\bD_1\bbf+\tilde{\bn}
\end{array}\label{bm}
\end{equation}
\noindent with $\bbf=\bB_2^{+}\bb_2$ the projection of $\bm$ onto
the interfering subspace of $\bS_2\bA_2\bB_2$, $\bD_1=\bA_1\bB_1$,
$\tilde{\bn}=-\bN\bB_2^{+}\bb_2$, and $[\cdot]^{+}$ the general
inverse.

With (\ref{bm}), the MAI $\bm$ can be estimated providing $\bbf$
is known. For this, we perform QR-decomposition on $\bS_1$ so
that~\cite{Huff91,Verd98}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\bS_1&=&\bQ_1\bR_1&=&\bQ_{11}\bR_{11}
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bQ_1=\left[\bQ_{11}\
\bQ_{12}\right]\in\mathbb{R}^{L\times L}$ is orthogonal and
$\bR_1=[\bR_{11}^{\rm H}\ \bzero^{\rm H}]^{\rm
H}\in\mathbb{R}^{L\times G}$, and apply $\bQ_{12}^{\rm H}$ on
(\ref{bm}) to get
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bQ_{12}^{\rm H}\bm&=&\bQ_{12}^{\rm H}\bcS\bbf+\bQ_{12}^{\rm
H}\tilde\bn
\end{array}.\label{Q_m}
\end{equation}
\noindent Combining (\ref{r_sync}), (\ref{bcs}) and (\ref{Q_m})
into
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bQ_{12}^{\rm H}\br&=&\bQ_{12}^{\rm
H}\bS_1\bA_1\bB_1+\bQ_{12}^{\rm H}\bm + \bQ_{12}^{\rm H}\bn
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\noindent $\bbf$ can be estimated from
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bQ_{12}^{\rm H}\br&=&\bQ_{12}^{\rm H}\bcS\bbf+\bQ_{12}^{\rm
H}\bar\bn
\end{array},\label{f2}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bar\bn=\tilde\bn+\bn$. After $\bbf$ is
estimated, $\bm$ can be estimated using (\ref{bm}) and extracted
from $\br$ so that the desired information vector $\bb_1$ as well
as $\bA_1$ can be detected and estimated from
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bS_1\bd_1&\approx&\br-\left(\bcS-\bS_1\hat\bD_1\right)\hat{\bbf}
\end{array},\label{br_bm}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bd_1=\bA_1\bb_1$, $\hat\bD_1$ denotes previous
detection outputs, which can be done using either Viterbi
algorithm or other sub-optimal detection schemes, and $\hat{\bbf}$
denotes an estimate of $\bbf$. Since the previous decision outputs
$\hat\bD_1$ are used for estimating $\bm$ and $\bA_1$ and
detecting $\bb_1$, this framework is named blind DFIC and shown in
Fig. 1.
\begin{figure} \center{
\includegraphics[width=3.2in]{BDFIC1.eps}
\caption{A decision feedback interference cancellation block
diagram} }\label{DFIC_diag}
\end{figure}
\section{Blind DFIC Schemes}
\subsection{\em Least Squares Interference Cancellation}
In traditional least squares estimations, the observation matrix
is assumed to be error-free and all estimation errors are supposed
to come from $\br$. This can be formulated by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.09in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\matrix{{\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny LS}}\cr\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
LS}}}\right]&=&\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bx}\left\|\br-\bG\bx\right\|_2
\end{array}\label{prob_LS}
\end{equation}
\noindent where
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bG&=&\left[\matrix{\bS_1&\left(\bcS-\bS_1\bD_1\right)}\right]
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\noindent $\bd_1$ as well as $\bbf$ can therefore be estimated by
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\matrix{{\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny LS}}\cr\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
LS}}}\right]&=&\bG^{+}\br.
\end{array}\label{b_LS_IC}
\end{equation}

Besides the traditional LS assumption, another one is to assume
both $\bG$ and $\br$ are noise-polluted so that (\ref{prob_LS})
becomes the total least squares (TLS) problem
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.12in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\matrix{{\bG}_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
TLS}}\cr\left[\matrix{{\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny
TLS}}\cr\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
TLS}}}\right]}\right]&=&\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bY,\
\bx}\left\|\left[\matrix{\bG\cr\br}\right]-\left[\matrix{\bY\cr\bY\bx}\right]\right\|_2
\end{array}.\label{prob_TLS}
\end{equation}
Let $\bG=\bU^{'}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{'}\bV^{'\rm T}$ and $[\bG\
\br]=\bU\mathbf{\Sigma}\bV^{\rm T}$ be the SVD of $\bG$ and $[\bG\
\br]$, respectively. If $\sigma_K^{'}
> \sigma_{K+1}$, the TLS estimation of $\bd_{1}$ and $\bbf$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\matrix{{\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny TLS}}\cr\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
TLS}}}\right]&=&\left(\bG^{\rm
T}\bG-\sigma_{K+1}^2\bI\right)^{-1}\bG^{\rm T}\br
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

In reality, either (\ref{prob_LS}) or (\ref{prob_TLS}) is not
accurate since $\bS_1$ is known to be noise-free and $\bcS$ is
noise-corrupted. It is more reasonable to require $\bS_1$ to be
unperturbed while keep $\bcS$ estimated. This leads to a mixed
least squares (MLS) interference cancellation problem
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.1in}
\begin{array}{l}
\left[\matrix{{\bcS}_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
MLS}}\cr\left[\matrix{{\bd}_{1}+\bD_{1}\bbf\cr\bbf}\right]}\right]=\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bZ,\
\by}\left\|\left[\matrix{\bcS\cr\br}\right]-\left[\matrix{\bZ\cr\left[\bS_1\
\bZ\right]\by}\right]\right\|_2
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\noindent If $\sigma_{K-G}'>\sigma_{K-G+1}$, the MLS estimation of
$\bbf$ is
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.070in}
\begin{array}{l}
{\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny MLS}}}=\left(\bcS^{\rm
H}\bQ_{12}\bQ_{12}^{\rm
H}\bcS-\sigma_{K-G+1}^{2}\bI\right)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
H}\bQ_{12}\bQ_{12}^{\rm H}\br
\end{array}\label{f_MLS}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\sigma_{K-G}'$ and $\sigma_{K-G+1}$ are the
$(K-G)$th and $(K-G+1)$th largest singular value of $\bQ_{12}^{\rm
H}\bcS$ and $\bQ_{12}^{\rm H}\left[\matrix{\br&\bcS}\right]$. The
MLS-IC ${\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny MLS}}$ can be expressed by
\begin{equation}%\hspace{0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny
MLS}}&=&\bS_{1}^{+}\br-\bS_{1}^{+}\left({\bcS}-{\bS}_{1}{\bD_1}\right){\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
MLS}}}
\end{array}\label{b_MLS_IC}
\end{equation}
\subsection{\em Maximum Likelihood Interference Cancellation}
In ML-IC, $\bd_1$ is estimated with maximizing the probability
density function $p(\br;\ \bd_{1},\ \bbf)$. It is known that ML
estimator asymptotically is a minimum variance unbiased (MVU)
estimator though it is suboptimal in general. For the linear
Gaussian signal model in (\ref{br_bm}), ML-IC can be written by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.12in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\matrix{{\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny ML}}\cr\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
ML}}}\right]&=&\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bx}\left\{\mathbf\delta^{\rm
H}\bR_{\bar\bn}\mathbf\delta\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\mathbf\delta=\br-\bG\bx$ is the estimation error
vector. Therefore the ML estimation of $\bd_1$ can be given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\matrix{{\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny ML}}\cr\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
ML}}}\right]&=&\left(\bG^{\rm
H}\bR_{\bar\bn}\bG\right)^{-1}\bG^{\rm H}\bR_{\bar\bn}^{-1}\br
\end{array}.\label{b_ML_IC}
\end{equation}
\subsection{\em Mini. Mean-Square Error Interference Cancellation}
With MMSE criterion, $\bd_{1}$ is estimated with minimizing the
Bayesian mean squared error (BMSE) and  The MMSE estimation can
then be written by
\begin{equation}%\hspace{0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\matrix{{\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny MMSE}}\cr\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
MMSE}}}\right]&=&\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bx}\mbox{E}\left\|\br-\bG\bx\right\|_2
\end{array}\label{MMSE_IC}
\end{equation}
\noindent If $\br$, $\bd_{1}$ and $\bbf$ are jointly Gaussian,
(\ref{MMSE_IC}) can be solved by
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\matrix{{\bd}_{1\mbox{\rm\tiny MMSE}}\cr\bbf_{\mbox{\rm\tiny
MMSE}}}\right]&=&\left(\bR_{\bx}+\bG^{\rm
H}\bR_{\bar\bn}\bG\right)^{-1}\bG^{\rm H}\bR_{\bar\bn}^{-1}\br
\end{array}\label{b_MMSE_IC}
\end{equation}
\noindent where
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bR_{\bx}&=&\mbox{E}\left\{\left[\matrix{\bd_{1}\bd_{1}^{\rm
H}&\bd_{1}\bbf^{\rm H} \cr \bbf\bd_{1}^{\rm H}&\bbf\bbf^{\rm
H}}\right]\right\}
\end{array}.%\label{b_ML_IC}
\end{equation}
\section{Implementation Considerations}
\subsection{\em Adaptive Detection}
When the channel experiences fading, it may be a good idea for the
receiver to response fast enough to track this fluctuation. With
(\ref{bcs}) and (\ref{br_bm}), it shows that the proposed DFIC
framework only requires $M$ previous symbols before the next
detection. However, it involves the inverse of $\bG^{\rm H}\bG$ in
(\ref{b_LS_IC}), $\bG^{\rm H}\bR_{\bar\bn}\bG$ in (\ref{b_ML_IC}).
One of the possible approaches is to follow the well-known
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix inverse lemma~\cite{Haykin96}.
For example, if we define
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bPhi[n]&=&\bG^{\rm H}[n]\bG[n]
\end{array},\label{R_G}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bG[n]$ denotes the instance of $\bG$ at $t=n$,
so that $\bPhi[n+1]$ can be rewritten by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bPhi[n+1]&=&\bPhi[n] + \bu[n]\bu^{\rm H}[n]
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
The inverse of $\bPhi[n+1]$ can be recursively calculated by
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.08in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bPhi^{-1}[n+1]&=&\bPhi^{-1}[n]-\frac{\bPhi^{-1}[n]\bu[n]\bu^{\rm
H}[n]\bPhi^{-1}[n]}{1+\bu^{\rm H}[n]\bPhi^{-1}[n]\bu[n]}
\end{array}.\label{adaptiveLS}
\end{equation}
\subsection{\em Iterative Detection}
The presented detection framework can be generalized by solving
the following optimization problem:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bd}_{1}&=&\min{f\left(\br;\ \bcS,\hat{\bD}_1\right)}
\end{array},\label{generalFramework}
\end{equation}
\noindent subject to possible constraints, where the
$f\left(\cdot\right)$ is the objective function. Iterative
detection is one the approaches for solving this optimization
problem with extending (\ref{generalFramework}) into
\begin{equation}%\hspace{-0.05in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bd}_{1}[n+1]&=&\min{f\left(\br;\ \left[\bcS\
\br\right],\left[\hat{\bD}_1\ \hat{\bd}_1[n]\right]\right)}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\subsection{\em Coded Blind Interference Cancellation}
In reality, an IC detector will cancel the interfering signal
exactly provided that the decision was correct and channel
information is known. Otherwise, it may increase the contribution
of the interferers. This means that the previous detection results
of $\bD_{1}$ play a critical role here. For better interference
estimation performance, channel coding/decoding schemes may be
applied with detecting $\bD_{1}$ before the next interference
estimation and signal detection.
%This can be shown in Fig.~\ref{Coded_DFIC}.

%cancellation} }\label{Coded_DFIC}

\section{Performance Analysis}
\subsection{\em A Comparison with Existing Blind Detectors}
\begin{figure*}[t]\label{SchemComp}\small
\center{Table 1. The comparison between the proposed framework and
other detection approaches}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
Parameters & Conv. DF-IC & Blind MMSE & Subspace Approaches & Blind DF-IC\\

\textbf{Latency} & $K$ & $1$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
\textbf{Complexity order} & $K$ & $1$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
\hline \hline \multicolumn{5}{l}{\tiny * For blind MMSE or
subspace approaches, they typically require much more than $L$
signals before their first detection.}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}
The comparison between the proposed framework and other major
schemes is presented in Table~1. The proposed framework only
requires $M$, where $L\ge M\ge (K-G)$, previously received signal
for signal detection and its complexity is closed to conventional
detectors while other blind approaches typically requires a lots
more than $L$ signals~\cite{Madh94,Wang98,Zhang02}.
\subsection{\em Noise Enhancement}
It is known that there is a noise enhancement issue in LS-based
decorrelating detection. With conventional decorrelating
detection, the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for user $k$ is
decreased by $\left[\bR_{\bs}^{+}\right]_{kk}$. Due to the noise
item $\bN$ in $\bcS$, there is an additional noise enhancement in
the proposed LS-DFIC. Following Girko's Law, providing
$\alpha=\frac{K-G}{M}$ is fixed, the diagonal element of
$\frac{1}{M}\left(\bB_2^{+}\bb_2\right)\left(\bB_2^{+}\bb_2\right)^{\rm
H}$ can be approximated to be $1-\alpha$ with $K$, $M$
$\rightarrow\infty$~\cite{Muller}. Therefore the covariance matrix
of $\bar\bn$ can be expressed by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bR_{\bar\bn}&=&\frac{2M+K-G}{M}\sigma^{2}\bI
\end{array}.\label{noise_var_new}
\end{equation}
\noindent Since $\frac{2M+K-G}{M}\sigma^{2}>\sigma^{2}$, the
receiver output noise is enhanced. This noise enhancement ratio
$\beta=\frac{2M+K-G}{M}$ is illustrated in Fig. 2.
\begin{figure}\center{
\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{noiseEnhancement2.eps}
\caption{ The noise enhancement, $K=10$ and $L=64$. }
}\label{BER_SNR}
\end{figure}
\subsection{\em AME and Near-Far Resistance}
A commonly used performance measure for a multiuser detector is
asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) and NFR~\cite{Verd98}. The
AME of the proposed schemes is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\eta}_k&=&{\frac{M}{2M+G-K}}\left[\bR_{\bs}^{+}\right]_{kk}^{-1}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\subsection{\em CRLB for $\bd_1$ and $\bbf$ Estimation}
The Cram\'{e}r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is given by the inverse of
the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Providing $\bcS$ and $\bD_1$
are known beforehand, we first define the parameter vector
$\mathbf{\phi} = \left[\bar{\sigma}^{2}\ \bd_1^{\rm T}\ \bbf^{\rm
T}\right]^{\rm T}$, where $\bar{\sigma}^{2}
=(1+\frac{M}{M+G-K})\sigma^{2}$, for computing the FIM
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bI(\mathbf{\phi})} &=& {\rm E} \left\{ \left( \frac{\partial
\ln{\cal L}}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}} \right) \left( \frac{\partial
\ln{\cal L}}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}} \right)^{\rm T} \right\}
\label{fim}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\ln{\cal L}$ is the log-likelihood function given
by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\ln{\cal
L}&=&C-L\ln\bar{\sigma}^2-\frac{1}{2\bar{\sigma}^2}\parallel\mathbf{e}\parallel_2^2
\end{array},\label{logl}
\end{equation}
\noindent $C$ is a constant and
$\mathbf{e}=\br-\bS_1\bd_1+(\bcS-\bS_1\bD_1)\bbf$. Providing
$\bcS$ and $\bD_1$ are known, the closed-form CRLB expression of
$\bd_1$ is then given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
{\rm CRLB}\left(\bx\ \big\arrowvert\ \bcS,\
\bD_1\right)=(1+\frac{M}{M+G-K})\sigma^{2}\left(\bG^{\rm
H}\bG\right)^{\rm +}
\end{array}.\label{CRLB_f}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bx=\left[\matrix{\bd_1^{\rm T}&\bbf^{\rm
T}}\right]^{\rm T}$.
\section{Computer Simulations}
There are $K=10$ users with the group size $G=3$ and the spreading
sequences used in simulations are $64$-chip ($L=64$) random
sequences. In the computer simulations, the previous $M$ amplitude
estimates are averaged for the next detection without additional
amplitude filtering. From Fig. 3, it shows that the performance of
the MMSE interference cancellor is comparable to single-user
matched filter (SU-MF) and the decorrelating detector when
interfering signal power is small. When the interfering signal
power becomes larger, the SU-MF suffers from the near-far issue
and BER performance become very bad since its near-far resistance
is small. However, the MMSE interference cancellor as well as the
LS interference cancellor still works very well with strong
near-far resistance. In Fig. 4, the near-far resistance of the
proposed interference cancellors is checked with changing
interfering signal power. We can see that the both the LS-based
and MMSE-based interference cancellors have good resistance to
interferences. But compared with the conventional decorrelating
detection, these decision-feedback interference cancellors have a
higher noise floor. This is also confirmed in the previous
analysis.

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, a blind IC framework and several implementations
are presented. They are simple and direct, which require a small
amount of previous symbols. Therefore, their implementation
complexity and detection delay can be much lower. In addition, its
performance in terms of BER, AME, CRLB, etc. is analyzed and
compared with existing receiver designs. Some tradeoffs between
complexity and performance gain can therefore be revealed.
