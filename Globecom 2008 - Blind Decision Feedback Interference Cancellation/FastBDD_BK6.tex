\begin{abstract}
Multiuser detection is one of the key techniques for combating
multiple access interference (MAI), including both in-cell MAI and
out-of-cell MAI, in code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems.
In this project, we propose a new blind multiuser detection
framework for both CDMA forward links and CDMA reverse links with
constructing a new blind system model. Based on this framework,
several new blind multiuser detection algorithms are developed
using least-squares-based (LS) estimations, including LS
estimation, total least-squares (TLS) estimation and mixed LS/TLS
(MLS) estimation, best least unbiased (BLU) estimation, minimum
mean-square error (MMSE) estimation criteria. Furthermore, these
proposed algorithms are extended to group-based blind algorithms
by separating known users, e.g., reverse link in-cell users, and
unknown users. All proposed algorithms are simple and direct. Only
the spreading sequences and timings of known users, including the
desired user(s), are required. No prior knowledge or estimation of
other unknown users' information is involved. Theoretical analysis
and computer simulations are finally provided to demonstrate the
proposed schemes too.

\section{Introduction}

Direct-sequence CDMA (DS/CDMA) techniques have attracted
increasing attention for efficient use of available bandwidth,
resistance to interference and flexibility to variable traffic
patterns. It has been recognized as one of the leading physical
layer design technologies for third generation and beyond mobile
communication systems. However, because of different channel
distortions and propagation delays, the orthogonality of received
signals cannot be guaranteed at both the base station and the
mobile stations. On the other hand, the base station and mobile
station actually receive signals not only from in-cell known or
unknown users but also many out-of-cell unknown users which may
accounted for 40\% of the received interference~\cite{Viterbi95}.
Hence, the conventional correlating receivers employed in the
current base stations and mobile stations suffer from so-called
near-far problem where a strong or near-by user can prevent the
detection of weak or far-away users. Multiuser detection (MUD)
strategy is a method to minimize the effect of MAI with exploiting
the interference structure. It can solve the near-far problem in
CDMA systems and therefore possibly achieve the attainable system
capacity, which should be decided by the thermal noise not
MAI~\cite{Verd86}.

MUD has been extensively investigated over the past several
years~\cite{Verd98}, since MAI is the dominant impairment for CDMA
systems and even exists in perfect power-controlled CDMA systems.
Most early work on multiuser detection assumed that the receiver
knew the spreading codes or had some knowledge of all users, then
exploited this knowledge to combat MAI. For example, the classic
decorrelating detector can achieve the optimum near-far resistance
and completely eliminate MAI from other users with the expense of
enhancing background noise. However, in many practical cases,
especially in a dynamic environment, e.g. in the downlink of the
CDMA system, it is difficult for a mobile user to obtain accurate
information of other active users even in the same channel. On the
other hand, the frequent use of training sequence is certainly a
waste of channel resource. So blind multiuser detection has been
proposed. Recent research has been devoted to blind multiuser
receivers and subspace-based signature waveform estimation schemes
to achieve better performance and higher
capacity~\cite{Madh94,Honi95, Poor97, Wang98, Torl97, Liu96}. The
MMSE methods and subspace-based methods were presented for
multiuser blind detection with the knowledge of only the desired
users' spreading code and possible timing.

Blind multiuser detectors can achieve good performance with the
knowledge of the time and signature waveform of desired user while
they don't require intensive computation, compared with many other
conventional multiuser detectors and optimal detectors. The blind
adaptive multiuser detectors in~\cite{Madh94,Honi95} are based on
the minimization of MMSE between the outputs and data. The
asymptotic form of MMSE multiuser detector is the same as the
conventional decorrelating detector. It is shown that the minimum
output energy (MOE) receiver in~\cite{Honi95} is equivalent to the
linear MMSE detector, which is near-far resistant and has much
less complexity compared the optimal multiuser detection. The
major limitation of MOE schemes to multiuser blind detection is
that there is a satuaration effect in the steady state, which
causes a significant performance gap between the converged blind
MOE and the true MMSE detector~\cite{Honi95}.

Blind multiuser detection using subspace techniques was first
developed by Wang and Poor~\cite{Wang98, Poor98}. Such techniques
were appropriate for the down-link environment where only the
desired users' code is available. More recently, these subspace
techniques were extended by Wang and Host-Madsen~\cite{Wang99},
named group multiuser blind detectors, to up-link environments
where the base station knows the codes of in-cell users, but not
those of users outside the cell. In the subspace-based blind
detection approach~\cite{Wang98}, the linear detectors are
constructed in the closed form once the signal subspace components
are computed and offer lower computational complexity and better
performance than the blind MOE detector. For the subspace-based
blind adaptive detector, the project approximation subspace
tracking deflation (PASTd) algorithm~\cite{Yang95} is used to
estimate the signal subspace.

As we see, various multiuser detection schemes have been developed
to mitigate the effects of MAI. The assumption for blind detection
design is obviously much closer to practical applications. So far,
most blind detectors are based on the conventional multiuser
system model which is intensively discussed in~\cite{Verd98}. They
normally either employ some converging procedure based on some
optimization criteria or try to restore other users's spreading
sequence or the signal/noise subspace before the detection of
desired user(s)'s information. It assumes that the receiver need
discover most unknown information before multiuser detection in
the conventional system model. In this work, we proposed an
alternative system model, a blind CDMA model for each individual
user. Different to the conventional system model, most parameters
in the proposed blind model have already been known. For example,
one of the key parameters in this model is so-called blind
spreading sequence matrix, which actually is a known matrix
constructed using the desired user(s)'s known spreading sequence
and several previously received signal vectors. Also different to
the conventional system model, usually it is necessary to
construct different spreading sequence matrix for each user, even
at different time. Based on this blind system model, a blind
multiuser detection framework and therefore several blind
multiuser detectors based on LS-liked estimations, BLU estimation
and MMSE estimation are proposed too. In the present multiuser
blind detectors, only the signature and timing of the desired user
are utilized. There is no adaptive or search procedures employed
as in other multiuser blind detection algorithms. Furthermore, we
also show that the same blind multiuser detection schemes can be
applied for both synchronous, asynchronous and group-based cases.
They are simple and direct. Theoretical analysis and computer
simulations are finally presented to demonstrate the performance
of these blind detectors.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
summarize the signal model. In Section III, we propose a new blind
multiuser model and the blind multiuser detection framework. In
Section IV, various estimation schemes are discussed for blind
detection. In Section V, we discuss the blind multiuser detection
algorithms for asynchronous cases. Group-wised blind multiuser
detection, initial setup and adaptive updating are discussed in
Section VI and VII. Performance analysis and simulation results
are provided in Section VIII and IX. Section X concludes this
papers.

\section{Conventional CDMA System Model And Problem Description}

In a CDMA system, the base station synchronously sends information
bits to each active in-cell user on forward links while these
users asynchronously send back information bits to the base
station on reverse link because of possible distance and timing
difference between each user and the base station. On CDMA forward
links, though the spreading sequences used by the base station are
orthogonal to each other, the orthogonality of spreading sequence
may not be guaranteed when received due to the distortion of the
multipath channel, possible timing error and so on. On reverse
links, easy mobile user individually sends information bits to the
base station. Though all mobile users may be perfectly
synchronized at the transmitter side, the spread signals on the
receiver side usually are asynchronous
 and not orthogonal to each other any more. This is because of the different travelling distance and channel distortion of each signal. In the following, the forward link and
 reverse link of CDMA system are described separately.

\subsection{CDMA Forward Link Model}

We consider forward link transmission in a single-cell DS/CDMA
system and there are $K$ simultaneous users  over the
nondispersive additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The
signature waveform of the $k$th user can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
s_k(t)&=&\sum\limits_{l=0}^{L-1}c_k[l]\psi(t-lT_c)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $c_k[l]\in \{-1/\sqrt{L},\ 1/\sqrt{L}\}$ is the
$l$th chip of the $k$th user, $L$ is the spreading gain, $T_c$ is
the chip interval and $\psi(t)$ is the chip waveform. We assume
that $\psi(t)$ satisfies the Nyquist criterion for zero inter-chip
interference and $\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}|\psi(t)|^2dt=1$.
The baseband representation of the received signal due to the
$k$th user is given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r_k(t)&=&\sum\limits_{i=-\infty}^{+\infty}A_k b_k[i]
s_k(t-iT_c-\tau)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $b_k[i]$ is the $i$th bit of the $k$th user,
$\tau$ denotes the transmission delay from base station to the
desired user and $A_k$ is the power of the received signal for the
$k$th user. We assume that the $b_k[i]$ are independent and
identically distributed random variables with
$\mbox{E}\left\{b_k[i]\right\}=0$ and
$\mbox{E}\left\{\left|b_k[i]\right|^2\right\}=1$. The baseband
signal received by this desired user then is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r(t)&=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}r_k(t)+n(t)\\
&=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}A_k b_k[i]s_k (t)+ n(t)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n(t)$ is AWGN with the variance $\sigma^2$.

The received signal is synchronized and passed through the
corresponding chip matched filter (CMF) and sampled at the chip
rate $1/T_c$. The vector of the output samples of the CMF for the
desired user in the $n$th symbol interval can be expressed
as\footnote{Without loss of the generality, if there no special
comment, the time variable $n$ is dropped in the following
discussion.}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br&=&\left[
\matrix{r(nT+T_c+\tau)&r(nT+2T_c+\tau)&\ldots&r(nT+LT_c+\tau)}\right]^{\rm
T}\\
 &=& \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} A_k b_k \bs_k + \bn \\
 &=& \bS \bA \bb + \bn
\end{array}\label{r_sync}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r(nT+lT_c+\tau)&=&\int\limits_{nT+lT_c+\tau}^{nT+(l+1)T_c+\tau}r(t)\psi(t)dt
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent for $1\leq l \leq L$,
$\bA=\mbox{diag}\left\{\left[\matrix{A_1\ A_2\ \ldots\
A_K}\right]\right\}$ is the received amplitude diagonal matrix,
$\bS = \left[\bs_1\ \bs_2\ \ldots\ \bs_K\right]$ is the $L \times
K$ received spreading sequence matrix with the $k$th column
$\bs_k$ being the sequence vector of the $k$th user, $\bb = [b_1\
b_2\ \ldots\ b_K]^{\rm T} = [b_1\ \tilde{\bb}^{\rm T}]^{\rm T}$ is
the information vector sent by all the $K$ users and $b_1$ is the
bit sent by the first user at time $t=n$, and $\bn$ is an
$L$-dimensional Gaussian vector with independent
$\sigma^2$-variance components, $[\cdot]^{\rm T}$ is the
transposition operator. We maintain the restriction that $L \geq
K$.


\subsection{CDMA Reverse Link Model}

On the reverse link of CDMA systems, the baseband representation
of the received signal due to the $k$th user is given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r_k(t)&=&\sum\limits_{i=-\infty}^{+\infty}A_k b_k[i]
s_k(t-iT_c-\tau_k)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\tau_k$ denotes the transmission delay from the
$k$th user to the base station. The baseband signal received at
the base station then is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r(t)&=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}r_k(t)+n(t)
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

The received signal is synchronized for each user, passed through
the corresponding CMF, and sampled at the chip rate $1/T_c$ too.
The vector of the output samples of the CMF for the $k$th user in
the $n$th symbol interval can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br_k&=&\left[
\matrix{r_k(nT+T_c+\tau_k)&r_k(nT+2T_c+\tau_k)&\ldots&r_k(nT+LT_c+\tau_k)}\right]^{\rm
T}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

To facilitate the analysis, we assume the system to be
chip-synchronous and restrict ourselves to the receiver that has
an observation window of one symbol interval here~\footnote{For
multiple-window case, it will be discussed in Section
\ref{BMUD_mw_async}.}. Without loss of generality, we consider the
detection of the first user. The received signal timing is
illustrated in Fig. \ref{channel}, where the observation window of
the first user is marked with a thick line. The signals of other
users are treated as interference and a typical interferer has two
different but consecutive symbols interfering the symbol of user
$1$.

\begin{figure}
\center{
\includegraphics[width=4in]{AsynchCDMA.eps}}
\caption{Asynchronous channel demonstration}\label{channel}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br_1&=&A_1b_1[n]\bs_1+\sum\limits_{k=2}^{K}A_k b_k[n-1]
\bs_{k_-}+\sum\limits_{k=2}^{K}A_k b_k[n] \bs_{k_+} + \bn
\end{array} \label{r}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bs_{k-}$ and $\bs_{k+}$ are named effective
signature sequences or part signature sequences that are
completely determined by the spreading sequences $\bs_k$ and the
delays relative to the first user $\tau_{k1}=\tau_k-\tau_1$.

Now, the received signal vector $\br$ is fed into a correlating
receiver bank that is matched to each user's spreading waveform to
yield the output signal vector

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\by&=&\bR(1)\bA\bb[n-1]+\bR(0)\bA\bb[n]+\bR^T(1)\bA\bb[n+1]+\bar{\bn}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the zero-mean Gaussian process $\bar{\bn}$ has
autocovariance matrix

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
E\{\bar{\bn}_i\bar{\bn}_j^T\}&=&\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\sigma^2\bR^T(1)&j=i+1\\ \sigma^2\bR(0)&j=i\\
\sigma^2\bR(1)&j=i-1\\ \mathbf{0}&|j-i|>1
\end{array}\right.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent and the matrices $\bR(0)$ and $\bR(1)$ are defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
R_{ij}(0)&=&\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1&j=i\\ \rho_{ij}&j<i\\ \rho_{ji}&j>i
\end{array}\right.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
R_{ij}(1)&=&\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0&j\geq i\\ \rho_{ij}&j<i
\end{array}\right.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Problem Description}

Multiuser detection is the techniques for mitigating the MAI at
either the base station or the mobile station. Most of the
conventional multiuser detection schemes assume the knowledge of
the spreading codes and channel parameters of the users that
contribute to the received signals for interference cancellations.
However, it is fair to assume that the base station is only aware
of some knowledge of those in-cell active user, not out-of-cell
unknown interferences. Then, the blind multiuser detection, which
is designed to work only with the knowledge of the spreading
sequences and channel parameters of the concerned users, is more
closed to practical applications. One of the earliest suggestions
to eliminate multiuser interference with a linear receiver was
proposed by Shnidman~\cite{Shni67}. Compared with other
centralized schemes, linear multiuser detectors can be implemented
in a decentralized fashion where only the user or users of
interest need be demodulated. It is much closed to practical
applications. Most of the linear multiuser detectors for
demodulating the $k$th user's data bit in (\ref{r}) is in the form
of a correlator followed by a hard limiter, which could be
expressed as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{b}_k &=& \mbox{sign}\{\bw_k^{\rm T}\br\}
\end{array} \label{linear}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bw_k \in \mathbb{R}^{L\times 1}$ is the linear
representation of multiuser detector.

\section{Blind Multiuser System Model And Detection Framework\label{BMUD_model}}

Most classic multiuser detection schemes assume knowledge of the
spreading waveform, amplitude and/or signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)
of all in-cell active users that contribute to received signals.
These receivers then exploit this knowledge to achieve optimal or
sub-optimal performance. These classic multiuser detectors have
comprehensively been investigated in~\cite{Verd98}. However, in
many practical situations, e.g. in the forward links of CDMA
mobile systems, it is difficult for the mobile station receivers
to known other existing users' information. So many blind
multiuser detectors are developed to operate without prior
knowledge regarding other users but using advanced signal
processing and estimation techniques to estimate other's
information or reconstruct signal/noise subspace. In this project,
instead of doing this, we take a completely different approach for
blind multiuser detection. Here, instead of trying to restore
other users' spreading sequence information, we propose a new
blind multiuser system model using a "faked" blind spreading
matrix for the desired user(s). We say it is a blind "faked"
spreading sequence matrix because 1) it only consists of the
desired user's spreading sequence and several previous received
signal vector and 2) it isn't a true original spreading sequence
matrix and there is no other active users' original spreading
sequences or amplitude in it. We then show that the desired user's
next information bits can be detected based on this blind
multiuser system model.

In the following, we present this novel blind multiuser system
model and detection framework. The major assumptions in our
development are

\begin{itemize}

\item The multiuser receiver structure is shown in Fig.
\ref{CDMA_links}. It is assumed that there are possible RAKE
receiver block and sequence estimation block before the MUD block.
So, the practical spreading sequence wave-form for each desired
user is assumed to be known before MUD. The same assumption is
true for both forward and reverse links.

\item For each propagation path of interfering signals, if it
cannot be combined by RAKE, it may be taken an individual
interference user.

\item Though the multipath problem can be mitigated using RAKE
before MUD, there still exist possible wave-form distortions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=5in]{CDMA_links.eps}}
\caption{A reverse link multiuser receiver}\label{CDMA_links}
\end{figure}



In this section, only the bits $b_1$ sent by the first user in a
synchronous CDMA system are considered. Blind multiuser detection
for asynchronous CDMA system and group-based CDMA systems will be
individually discussed in the next serval sections.

\subsection{Blind Multiuser System Model}
At first we construct a new $L\times M$ blind spreading sequence
matrix $\bcS$ which is defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bcS&=&[\matrix{\bar{\bs}_1&\bar{\bs}_2&\bar{\bs}_3&\ldots&\bar{\bs}_M}]\\
 &=&[\matrix{\bs_1&{\br}_{1}&{\br}_{2}&\ldots&{\br}_{M-1}}]\\
 &=&\left[\matrix{\bS\be_1&\bS{\bar\bb}_1&\bS{\bar\bb}_2&\ldots&\bS{\bar\bb}_{M-1}}\right] + {\bN}\\
 &=&\bS\left[\matrix{\be_1&{\bar\bb}_1&{\bar\bb}_2&\ldots&{\bar\bb}_{M-1}}\right] + {\bN}\\
 &=&\bS\left[\matrix{\be_1 & \bD }\right] + {\bN}\\
 &=&\bS\bB + {\bN}
\end{array} \label{S_0}
\end{equation}

\noindent where ${\br}_i$, $i=1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ M-1$, are $M-1$
previously received independent vectors and the $K\times 1$ vector
${\bar\bb}_i=\left[\matrix{A_1b_1[i] & A_2b_2[i]& \ldots &
A_Kb_K[i]}\right]^{\rm T} = \bA\bb_i $ is the corresponding bit
vector for all $K$ users, $M\geq K$, $\bD = [{\bd}\
\tilde{\bD}^{\rm T}]^{\rm T}$ and the $(M-1)\times 1 $ vector
${\bd}$ is the known vector previously sent for the $1$st user,
${\bN}=[\mathbf{0}\ \tilde{\bN}]$ is a new noise matrix where the
first column is a zero vector and other columns are AWGN vectors
with the same distribution,

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
 \bB&=&\left[\matrix{\be_1 & \bD }\right]\\
  &=&\left[\matrix{\bg^{\rm T} \cr \matrix{\mathbf{0}& \tilde{\bD}}
 }\right]\\
 &=&\left[\matrix{\be_1 & \matrix{ {\bd}^{\rm T}\cr\tilde{\bD}} }\right]\\
 &=&\left[\matrix{1& \bd^{\rm T} \cr \mathbf{0}& \tilde{\bD}
 }\right]

\end{array}\label{B}
\end{equation}

\noindent is the information matrix associated with $\bcS$. $\bg =
\left[\matrix{1& \bd^{\rm T}}\right]^{\rm T}$ is a known
information vector to the $1$st user,
$\mbox{rank}\{\tilde{\bD}\}=K-1$ and $\mbox{rank}\{\bB\}=K$.

Combining (\ref{r_sync}) and (\ref{S_0}), the received signal
vector $\br$ can now be expressed by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br&=&\bS\bA\bb + \bn\\
 &=&\bS\bB\bB^{+}\bar\bb + \bn\\
 &=&(\bcS-{\bN})\bB^{+}\bar\bb + \bn\\
 &=&\bcS\bB^{+}
 \bar\bb - {\bN}\bB^{+}\bar\bb + \bn\\
 &=&\bcS\bbf + \bar{\bn} \label{r_blind}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bar\bb =\bA\bb= \left[A_1b_1[n]\ A_2b_2[n]\
\ldots\ A_Kb_K[n]\right]^{\rm T} = \left[A_1b_1\ \tilde{\bb}^{\rm
T}\right]^{\rm T}$, $\bB^{+} $ is the Moore-Penrose matrix inverse
of $\bB$ and the $K \times 1$ vector $\bbf$ is termed the
detection vector and defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}

\end{equation}

\noindent with the mean vector $\bm_{\bbf}=\bzero$ and the
covariance matrix $\bC_{\bbf}=\mbox{E}\left\{\bbf \bbf^{\rm

T}\right\}
\end{array} \label{var_n}
\end{equation}

\noindent and $\mbox{E}\left\{\cdot\right\}$ is the expectation
operator.


\subsection{Blind Multiuser Detection Framework}

Before giving blind multiuser detection framework, we show a
semiblind multiuser detection framework providing that the
amplitude $A_1$ of the first user is already known. It will be
shown that $A_1$ can be actually estimated with $b_1$ at the same
time. $b_1$ can be estimated using the following theorem.


\begin{lemma}
The bit $b_1$ sent for the first user at time $t=n$ can be
detected by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{b}_1 &=& \mbox{sign}\left\{\hat{A}_1\hat{b}_1\right\}\\
&=&\mbox{sign}\left\{\bg^{\rm T}\bbf\right\}\ .
\end{array}
\end{equation} \label{b_estimation}
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}

At first, $b_1$ can be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{b}_1&=&\mbox{sign}\left\{A_1b_1-{\bd}^{\rm T}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}+{\bd}^{\rm T}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}\right\}\\
&=& \mbox{sign}\left\{\left[\matrix{1&{\bd}^{\rm
T}}\right]\left[\matrix{A_1b_1-{\bd}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}\cr\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}}\right]\right\}\\
&=& \mbox{sign}\left\{\bg^{\rm T}\left[\matrix{1&-{\bd}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}^{+}}\right]\left[\matrix{A_1b_1\cr\tilde{\bb}}\right]\right\}\\
&=& \mbox{sign}\left\{\bg^{\rm T}\left[\matrix{1&-{\bd}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}^{+}}\right]\bar\bb\right\}
\end{array}\label{b1}
\end{equation}


\noindent On the other hand, with (\ref{B}), we know that

\begin{equation}
\bB\left[\be_1\ \matrix{-{\bd}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^+\cr\tilde{\bD}^+}\right]\bB
=\left[\matrix{1&{\bd}^{\rm
T}\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}}\right]\left[\matrix{1&-{\bd}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^+\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}^+}\right]\left[\matrix{1&{\bd}^{\rm
T}\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}}\right] =\bB\ . \label{psedoB1}
\end{equation}

\noindent So, the Moore-Penrose Matrix inverse $\bB^{+}$ of $\bB$
can be written by

\begin{equation}
\bB^{+} =\left[\matrix{1&-{\bd}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^+\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}^+}\right]\ . \label{psedoB2}
\end{equation}


\noindent Using (\ref{B}) and (\ref{psedoB2}), (\ref{b1}) can be
re-written by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{b}_1&=& \mbox{sign}\left\{\bg^{\rm T}\bB^{+}\bb\right\}\\
&=& \mbox{sign}\left\{\bg^{\rm T}\bbf\right\}\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent and the detection vector $\bbf$ can be re-written by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bbf&=&\left[\matrix{A_1b_1-{\bd}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}\cr\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}}\right]
\end{array} \label{DetectorVector2}
\end{equation}


This lemma is then proven.
\end{proof}



Now, the classic multiuser detection model (\ref{r}) is
transferred into (\ref{r_blind}) with $\bA\bb$ being replaced by
the detection vector $\bbf$ in (\ref{DetectorVector2}) and the
original AWGN vector $\bn$ being replaced by $\bar{\bn}$ in
(\ref{new_noise}). The comparison between the classic system model
and the proposed model is detailed in Tab.~\ref{ModelComp}.
Fortunately, the bit $b_1$ sent for user 1 can still be detected
using the detection vector $\bbf$ and the previously detected bits
vector $\bg$, which is proven in  Lemma \ref{b_estimation}.
Finally the multiuser detection question for user $1$ becomes how
to efficiently estimate $\bbf$ and construct $\bcS$ and $\bg$.

\section{Blind Multiuser Detectors\label{LBD}}

With Lemma \ref{b_estimation}, the proposed blind multiuser
detection framework can be illustrated in Fig.~\ref{MUDstruct}. We
can see that the performance of this blind multiuser detection
frame work highly depends on the estimation of $\bbf$ and the
accuracy of $\bg$. The estimation of $\bbf$ can be a typical
linear estimation problem. In the following, we discuss various
algorithms for estimating $\bbf$ using different criteria, which
including LS, BLU, MMSE criteria. The formulations of different
blind multiuser detectors are presented following each estimation
scheme.
\begin{figure}
\center{
\includegraphics[width=6in]{BMUD_structure1.eps}
\caption{ The proposed blind multiuser detection structure.}
}\label{MUDstruct}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Least-Squares-Based Blind Detections}
Let us start from minimizing LS errors. LS-based algorithms are
widely used in practices because they are simple and easy to be
implemented. They only use signal models without any probabilistic
assumptions about data. The negative side, no claims about
optimality can be made and the statistical performance cannot be
assessed without some specific assumption about the probabilistic
structure of the data. According to the classic LS method, it is a
"best" fit scheme with minimizing the sum of squares of difference
between $\br$ and $\bcS\hat{\bbf}$. In a typical LS estimation
model, it normally assumes that the data matrix $\bcS$ is
error-free. Obviously this assumption cannot be true for our
proposed blind system model. Therefore, the LS, TLS and MLS blind
detections are proposed with different assumptions regarding
$\bcS$.

\subsubsection{Least Squares Detection }
At first, we assume that the measurements of $\bcS$ are assumed to
be free of error. All errors are confined to the received vector
$\br$. Hence, the detection vector can be estimated with solving
the following equation

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm
LS}=\matrix{\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bx}\left\|\br-\bcS\bx\right\|_2}&\mbox{subject
to}&\br\subseteq \mathbb{R}(\bcS)
\end{array}
\label{LSProb}
\end{equation}

Suppose $\bU^T\bcS\bV=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is the SVD of
$\bcS\in\mathbb{R}^{L\times
 K}$ with $r=\mbox{rank}(\bcS)$. And if $\bU=[\matrix{\bu_1&\bu_2&\ldots&\bu_L}]$,
 $\bV=[\matrix{\bv_1&\bv_2&\ldots&\bv_K}]$, $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mbox{diag}\{[\matrix{\sigma_1&\ldots\sigma_r&0&\ldots&0}]\}$ and $\br\in \mathbb{R}^{L\times 1}$,
 then LS estimation of $\bbf$ is

 \begin{equation}
 \begin{array}{rcccl}
 \matrix{\bbf_{\rm
 LS}&=&\sum\limits_{i=1}^{r}\frac{\bu_i^{\rm T}\br}{\sigma_i}\bv_i&=&\bcS^+\br}&=&\bbf + \bcS^+\bar{\bn}
 \end{array}
 \end{equation}

\noindent which minimizes $\|\bcS\bd-\br\|_2$ and has the smallest
2-norm of all minimizers. Moreover
 \begin{equation}
 \matrix{\varepsilon_{\rm LS}^2 &=& \min\limits_{\bx\in\mathbb{R}}\|\bcS\bx-\br\|_2^2 &=& \sum\limits_{i=r+1}^{L}(\bu_i^{\rm T}\br)^2}
 \end{equation}

\noindent The linear filter representation of the least squares
detector can be written by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bw_{\rm LS}&=&\bcS^{+\rm T}\bg
\end{array}. \label{w_LS}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Total Least Squares Estimation}

It assume $\bcS$ to be error-free in the previous LS estimate of
the detection vector $\bbf$. However, this assumption is not
entirely accurate according to the definition of $\bcS$ in
(\ref{S}) since there is a noise term, $\bN$. On the other hand,
$\br$ can also be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br&=&(\bcS-\bN)\bB^{+}\bb + \bn\\
 &=&\hat{\bcS}\bd + \bn
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where  $\hat{\bcS}=\bcS-\bN=\bS\bB$.  The minimization problem of
(\ref{LSProb}) can then be transformed into the following TLS
problem:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\bcS_{\rm TLS},\ \bbf_{\rm
TLS}\right]&=&\matrix{\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bar{\bcS},\
\bx}\left\|\left[ \matrix{\bcS&\br} \right] - \left[
\matrix{\bar{\bcS}& \bar{\bcS}\bx}\right]\right\|_2}
\end{array},
\label{TLSProb}
\end{equation}
subject to $\br\subseteq\mathbb{R}(\bar{\bcS})$.

 Let $\bcS=\bU^{'}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{'}\bV^{'\rm T}$ and
$[\bcS\ \br]=\bU\mathbf{\Sigma}\bV^{\rm T}$ be the SVD of $\bcS$
and $[\bcS\ \br]$, respectively. If $\sigma_K^{'}
> \sigma_{K+1}$, TLS estimation of $\bbf$ then is
\begin{equation}
\bbf_{\rm TLS} = \left(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bcS-\sigma_{K+1}^2\bI\right)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm T}\br
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\varepsilon_{\rm TLS}^{2}&=&\min\limits_{\bx\in
\mathbb{R}^{K\times
1}}\|\bcS\bx-\br\|_2^2 \\
 &=& \sigma_{K+1}^2\left[1+\sum_{i+1}^{K}\frac{\left(\bu_i^{'\rm T}\br\right)^2}
{\sigma_i^{'2}-\sigma_{K+1}^2}\right]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\bU=[\bu_1\ \bu_2\ \ldots\ \bu_L]$, $\bV=[\bv_1\ \bv_2\
\ldots\ \bv_{K+1}]$, $\mathbf{\Sigma}={\rm diag}\{[\sigma_1\
\sigma_2 \ldots\ \sigma_{K+\min\limits\{L-K,\ 1\}}]\}$ and
$\bU^{'}=[\bu_1^{'}\ \bu_2^{'}\ \ldots\ \bu_L^{'}]$,
 $\bV^{'}=[\bv_1^{'}\ \bv_2^{'}\ \ldots\ \bv_{K}^{'}]$,
 $\mathbf{\Sigma}^{'}={\rm diag}\{[\sigma_1^{'}\ \sigma_2^{'}\ \ldots\
 \sigma_K^{'}]\}$. And the linear filter $\bw_{\rm TLS}$ is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bw_{\rm TLS}&=&\bcS(\bcS^{\rm T}\bcS-\sigma_{K+1}^2\bI)^{-1}\bg
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Mixed LS/TLS Detection}

In the LS problem of (\ref{LSProb}), it assumed the blind
signature matrix $\bcS$ is error-free. Again, this assumption is
not completely accurate. In the TLS problem of (\ref{TLSProb}), it
assumed that in each column of the blind signature matrix, $\bcS$,
some noise or error exists.  This assumption also is not complete.
Though there exists a noise or error matrix $\bN$ in $\bcS$ from
(\ref{S}), its first column is exactly known to be noise-free or
error-free.  Hence, to maximize the estimation accuracy of the
detection vector $\bbf$, it is natural to require that the
corresponding columns of $\bcS$ be unperturbed since they are
known exactly. The problem  of estimating the detection vector
$\bd$ can then be transformed into the following MLS problem by
considering (\ref{LSProb}) and (\ref{TLSProb}):
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\bcS_{\rm MLS},\ \bbf_{\rm MLS}\right] &=
&\matrix{\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bar{\bcS},\
\bx}\left\|\left[\matrix{\tilde{\bcS}&\br}\right]-\left[\matrix{\bar{\bcS}&[\bs_1\
 \bar{\bcS}]\bx}\right]\right\|_{2} }
\end{array}\label{MLSProb}
\end{equation}
subject to $\br\subseteq\mathbb{R}\left([\bs_1\
\bar{\bcS}]\right)$. The following lemma outlines the MLS
solution.

Consider the MLS problem in (\ref{MLSProb}) and perform the
Householder transformation $\bQ$ on the matrix
$[\matrix{\bcS&\br}]$ so that
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bQ^{\rm
T}[\matrix{\bs_1&\bar{\bcS}&\br}]&=&\left[\matrix{R_{11}&\bR_{12}&R_{1r}\cr
\mathbf{0}&\bR_{22}&\bR_{2r}}\right]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $R_{11}= A_1$, $\bR_{12}$ is a $1\times (M-1)$ vector,
$\bR_{22}$ is a $(L-1)\times (M-1)$ matrix and $\bR_{2r}$ is a
$(L-1)\times 1$ vector and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bQ &=&\bI - \frac{1}{A_1(A_1-s_{11})}\left[\matrix{s_{11}-A_1\cr
s_{12}\cr \vdots \cr s_{1L}}\right]\left[\matrix{(s_{11}-A_1)&
s_{12}& \cdots & s_{1L}}\right]
\end{array}
\end{equation}



Denote $\sigma'$ as the smallest singular value of $\bR_{22}$ and
$\sigma$ as the smallest singular value of
$[\matrix{\bR_{22}&\bR_{2r}}]$. If $\sigma'>\sigma$, then the MLS
solution uniquely exists and is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bbf_{\rm MLS}&=&\left(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bcS-\sigma^2\left[\matrix{0&\mathbf{0}\cr\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{I}_{M-1}}\right]\right)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\br
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\noindent The linear filter representation of this MLS detection
is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bw_{\rm MLS}&=&\bcS\left(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bcS-\sigma^2\left[\matrix{0&\mathbf{0}\cr\mathbf{0}&\mathbf{I}_{M-1}}\right]\right)^{-1}\bg
\end{array}.
\end{equation}




\subsection{Best Linear Unbiased Detection}

We begin by assuming the linear structure

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm BLU}&=&\bW_{\rm BLU}^{\rm T}\br
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent for this so-called best linear unbiased estimator
(BLUE). Matrix $\bW_{\rm BLU}$ is designed such that: 1) $\bcS$
must be deterministic, and 2) $\bar{\bn}$ must be zero mean with
positive definite known covariance matrix $\bC_{\bar{\bn}}$, 3)
${\bbf}_{\rm BLU}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\bbf$, and 4) the
error variance for each of the $M$ parameters is minimized as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bW_{\rm BLU}&=&\min\limits_{\bW_{\bbf}}
\mbox{var}\left\{\bW_{\bbf}^{\rm T}\br\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

In this way, ${\bbf}_{\rm BLU}$ will be unbiased and efficient,
within the class of linear estimators, by design. The resulting
best linear unbiased estimator is (Gauss-Markov Theorem):

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bW}_{\rm BLU}&=&\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm BLU}&=&\bW_{\rm BLU}^{\rm T}\br\\
 &=&(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\br\ .
\end{array} \label{BLUE}
\end{equation}

\noindent The covariance matrix of ${\bbf}_{\rm BLU}$ given by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bC}_{\bbf_{\rm BLU}}&=&(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Since the above data are of Gaussian distributions, the
BLUE in (\ref{BLUE}) is also the minimum variance unbiased
estimation. The linear filter representation of this detector is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bw}_{\rm BLU}$=$\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-T}\bcS(\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bg
\end{array}.\label{w_BLUE}
\end{equation}

Now the question is how we know about $\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}$. With
(\ref{var_n}), $\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}$ can be decided by $\sigma^2$
and $\bC_{\bbf}$. Let us consider $\bC_{\bbf}$ first.




Though the PDF of $\bB$ may be determined, the PDF of $\bB^{+}$ is
largely unknown. This makes it is hard to calculate the
closed-form solution of $\bC_{\bbf}$ and $\bC_{\tilde{\bn}}$.
However, with Girko's Law, when $\alpha=(K-1)/(M-1)$ is fixed,
$K$, $M$ $\rightarrow\infty$, the diagonal element of
$\frac{1}{M-1}\tilde{\bD}^+\tilde{\bb}\tilde{\bb}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm +T}$ may be approximated
by~\cite{Muller,Hanly90}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{1}{M-1}\left[\tilde{\bD}^+\tilde{\bb}\tilde{\bb}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm +T}\right]_{ii}^{-1}&\rightarrow&1-\alpha
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\noindent So, $\bC_{\bbf}$ can be approximated by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bC_{\bbf}&=&\mbox{E}\left\{\bbf\bbf^{\rm T}\right\}\\
&=&\mbox{E}\left\{\left[\matrix{(A_1b_1-\bd^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm +}\tilde{\bb})^2&(A_1b_1-\bd^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm +}\tilde{\bb})\tilde{\bb}^{\rm
T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm +T}\cr (A_1b_1-\bd^{\rm T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm
+}\tilde{\bb})\tilde{\bD}^+\tilde{\bb}&
\tilde{\bD}^+\tilde{\bb}\tilde{\bb}^{\rm T}\tilde{\bD}^{\rm
+T}}\right]\right\}\\
&\approx&\left[\matrix{\frac{2M-K-1}{M-K}A_1^2&\bzero^{\rm
T}\cr\bzero&\frac{1}{M-K}\bI}\right]
\end{array}
\end{equation}


Now, the following result could be easily obtained.


\subsection{Minimum Mean Square Detection}
Now we propose a linear estimator based on MMSE criterion. This
class of estimators are generically termed Wiener filter. Given
measurements $\br$, the MSE estimator of $\bbf$, ${\bbf}_{\rm MS}
= f( \br )$, minimizes the mean-squared error $J_{\rm
MS}=E\{||\bbf-\hat{\bbf}||_2^2\}$. The function $f(\br)$ may be
nonlinear or linear and its exact structure is determined by
minimizing $J_{\rm MS}$. When $\bbf$ and $\br$ are jointly
Gaussian, the linear estimator $\bW_{\rm MS}$ that minimizes the
mean-sqared error is (Bayesian Gauss-Markov Theorem)

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bW}_{\rm MS} &=&
\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS(\bC_{\bbf}^{-1}+\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}
\end{array}\label{W_MSE}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
{\bbf}_{\rm MS} &=&{\bW}_{\rm MS}^{\rm T}\br
&=&(\bC_{\bbf}^{-1}+\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\br
\end{array}. \label{MSE}
\end{equation}

\noindent The performance of the linear MMSE estimator is measured
by the error vector $\mathbf{\varepsilon_{\rm MS}}=\bbf-\bbf_{\rm
MS}$ whose mean is zero and covariance matrix is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bC_{\mathbf{\varepsilon_{\rm MS}}} &=& (\bC_{\bbf}^{-1}+\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

The linear filter representation of the blind linear MMSE detector
with $\bbf_{\rm MS}$ is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bw}_{\rm MS}&=&
\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-T}\bcS(\bC_{\bbf}^{-1}+\bcS^{\rm
T}\bC_{\bar{\bn}}^{-1}\bcS)^{-1}\bg
\end{array} \label{w_MSE}
\end{equation}

\section{Multi-Window Asynchronous Blind Multiuser Detection\label{BMUD_mw_async}}
For asynchronous cases, Verd\'{u} suggested to use a one-shot
version of his decorrelating detector, the truncated-window
decorrelating detector of single window length, in which
$1+2(K-1)=2K-1$ filters, where $K$ is the number of users, are
matched to one full code of a specific user (without loss of
generality, called the first user) and two filters matched to each
of the other users. One filter is matched to the \textquotedblleft
previous\textquotedblright\ part of its code, corresponding to the
time between zero and $\tau_k$, where $\tau_k$ is the delay of
user $k$ with respect to the first user, and to the
\textquotedblleft current\textquotedblright\ part of the code,
corresponding to the time between $\tau_k$ and $T$. In this case,
it not only requires the information about other active users'
signature but also the time delay of other users with respect to
the desired user. Furthermore, since only the signature
information of the other users is spared in a signature matrix of
the nearly doubled size, the performance of this one-short
decorrelating detector is worse than the complete asynchronouse
decorrelating detector in terms of both bit-error rate (BER) and
near-far resistance (NFR)~\cite{Verd98}. Here, a multiple-windowed
scheme is proposed instead. Without loss of the generality, we
show the detection of the bits sent by user $1$ at $P$ consecutive
time intervals $t=n-P+1$, $n-P+2$, $\ldots$, $n$, where $P$ is the
size of the detection window. And the $P$ consecutive information
bits in the signal vector $\bb_1$ will be simultaneously detected.
For this, a new $PL\times M$ blind signature matrix $\bcS$ is
defined by


\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bcS&=&[\matrix{\bar{\bs}_1&\bar{\bs}_2&\bar{\bs}_3&\ldots&\bar{\bs}_M}]\\
 &=&[\matrix{\bI_P \otimes\bs_1&{\br}_{1}&{\br}_{2}&\ldots&{\br}_{M-P}}]\\
 &=&\left[\matrix{\bS\bE_p&\bS\bar{\bb}_1&\bS\bar{\bb}_2&\ldots&\bS\bar{\bb}_{M-P}}\right]+ {\bN}\\
 &=&\bS\left[\matrix{\bE_p&\bar{\bb}_1&\bar{\bb}_2&\ldots&\bar{\bb}_{M-P}}\right]+ {\bN}\\
 &=&\bS\left[\matrix{\bE_p & \bD }\right]+ {\bN}\\
 &=&\bS\bB + {\bN}
\end{array} \label{S}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bS$ becomes
$\left[\matrix{\bar{\bS}_1&\bar{\bS}_2&\bar{\bS}_3&\ldots&\bar{\bS}_K}\right]$
is a $PL\times (PK+K-1)$ matrix with

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rclcl}
\bar{\bS}_1&=&\bI_P\otimes\bs_1
&=&\mbox{diag}\left\{\matrix{\bs_1&\bs_1&\ldots&\bs_1}\right\}_{PL\times
P}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\bS}_k&=&\mbox{diag}\left\{\matrix{\bs_{k-}&\bs_k&\ldots&\bs_k&\bs_{k+}}\right\}_{PL\times
(P+1)}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}

straightforward to prove that the bits vector $\bb_1$ which
consists of $P$ bits sent by User 1 at the consecutive time
intervals $t=n-P+1$, $n-P+2$, $\ldots$, $n$ can be estimated using
the following conclusion.

\begin{lemma}
The bit vector $\bb_1$ sent for the first user at the consecutive
time intervals $t=n-P+1$, $n-P+2$, $\ldots$, $n$ can be detected
by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}

\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}

At first, $\bb_1$ can be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_1&=&\mbox{sign}\left\{A_1\bb_1-{\bar{\bD}}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}+{\bar{\bD}}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}\right\}\\

\section{Group-Wised Blind Multiuser Detection}
The concept of group-based multiuser detection was originally
introduced for designing low-complexity and suboptimal multiuser
detectors with partition all active users into several disjoint
smaller-sized groups. Normally these group detectors operate
parallelly while each group detector uses the decision of other
groups to do interference cancellations in a sequential
style~\cite{Mahesh95}. Recently, this concept is extended for
multiuser detection with the separation of in-cell users and
out-of-cell users at the base station of CDMA
system~\cite{Wang99A}, since both base station and mobile station
can receive in-cell signals and out-of-cell interference as in
Fig. \ref{CDMA_grouplinks}. It can be used help both decrease the
computation complexity of multiuser receiver and improve its
performance.

\subsection{Group Blind Multiuser Detection For Forward Link}
In CDMA system, each active mobile station may need communication
with the base station using multiple physical channels which are
generated using different spreading sequences. For example, the
base station want to increase the forward-link data rate for some
users. This can be done using multiple traffic channel for each
user. Or, in some statuses, a mobile station need detect not only
traffic channel(s) but also some signal or control channel(s). At
this time, this mobile station normally knows multiple in-use
spreading sequences for its forward channels while having no
knowledge of the rest channels. At this time, we construct a
$L\times M$ group blind spreading sequence matrix $\bcS$ which is
defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bcS&=&[\matrix{\bar{\bs}_1&\bar{\bs}_2&\bar{\bs}_3&\ldots&\bar{\bs}_M}]\\
 &=&[\matrix{\bs_1&\bs_{2}&\ldots&\bs_{g}&{\br}_{1}&{\br}_{2}&\ldots&{\br}_{M-g}}]\\
 &=&\left[\matrix{\bS\bE_g&\bS{\bar\bb}_1&\bS{\bar\bb}_2&\ldots&\bS{\bar\bb}_{M-1}}\right] + {\bN}\\
 &=&\bS\left[\matrix{\bE_g&{\bar\bb}_1&{\bar\bb}_2&\ldots&{\bar\bb}_{M-1}}\right] + {\bN}\\
 &=&\bS\left[\matrix{\bE_g & \bD }\right] + {\bN}\\
 &=&\bS\bB + {\bN}
\end{array} \label{S_FL_g}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bs_i$, $i=1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ g$ are $g$ known
spreading sequences in the group $\cal G$, ${\br}_j$ is a
previously received independent vectors and the $K\times 1$ vector
${\bar\bb}_i=\left[\matrix{A_1b_1[i] & A_2b_2[i]& \ldots &
A_Kb_K[i]}\right]^{\rm T} = \bA\bb_i $ is the corresponding
information vector for all $K$ users, $j=1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ M-g$,
$M\geq K$, $\bD = [\bar{\bD}^{\rm T}\ \tilde{\bD}^{\rm T}]^{\rm
T}$ and the $g\times (M-1)$ vector $\bar{\bD}$ is the known bit
matrix previously sent for the $1$st user, ${\bN}=[\mathbf{0}\
\tilde{\bN}]$ is a new noise matrix where the first column is a
zero vector and other columns are AWGN vectors with the same
distribution,

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
 \bB&=&\left[\matrix{\bE_g & \bD }\right]\\
  &=&\left[\matrix{\bG_g \cr \matrix{\mathbf{0}& \tilde{\bD}}
 }\right]\\
 &=&\left[\matrix{\bE_g & \matrix{ \bar{\bD}\cr\tilde{\bD}} }\right]\\
 &=&\left[\matrix{\bI_g& \bar\bD \cr \mathbf{0}& \tilde{\bD}
 }\right]

\end{array}\label{B_g}
\end{equation}

\noindent is the information matrix associated with the blind
spreading sequence matrix $\bcS$. $\bG_g = \left[\matrix{\bI_g&
\bar\bD}\right]$ is a known bit matrix to the $1$st user,
$\mbox{rank}\{\tilde{\bD}\}=K-1$ and $\mbox{rank}\{\bB\}=K$.

Combining (\ref{r}) and (\ref{S_FL_g}), the received signal vector
$\br$ can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br&=&\bS\bA\bb + \bn\\
 &=&\bS\bB\bB^{+}\bar\bb + \bn\\
 &=&(\bcS-{\bN})\bB^{+}\bar\bb + \bn\\
 &=&\bcS\bB^{+}
 \bar\bb - {\bN}\bB^{+}\bar\bb + \bn\\
 &=&\bcS\bbf + \bar{\bn} \label{rn_g_FL}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bar\bb =\bA\bb= \left[A_1b_1[n]\ A_2b_2[n]\
\ldots\ A_Kb_K[n]\right]^{\rm T} = \left[\bA_g\bb_g^{\rm T}\
\tilde{\bb}^{\rm T}\right]^{\rm T}$, $\bB^{+} $ is the
Moore-Penrose matrix inverse of $\bB$ and $\bbf$ is termed the $K
\times 1$ detection vector defined by

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bbf&=&\left[\matrix{\bar\bbf\cr\tilde{\bbf}}\right]\\
 &=&\bB^{+}\bar\bb\\
 &=&\left[\matrix{\bE_g&\bD}\right]^{+}\bar\bb\\
 &=&\left[\matrix{\bI_g&\bar{\bD}\cr\mathbf{0}&\tilde{\bD}}\right]^{+}\left[\matrix{\bA_g\bb_g\cr\tilde{\bb}}\right]\
 .
\end{array} \label{DetectorVector_g_FL}
\end{equation}

It is very straightforward to prove that the bits vector $\bb_g$
sent by a group known users at the time $t=n$ can be estimated
using the following conclusion.

\begin{lemma}
The bit vector $\bb_g$ sent for the group of user $\cal G$ at the
time interval $t=n$ can be detected by

\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}

At first, $\bb_g$ can be estimated by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}

\mbox{sign}\left\{\left[\matrix{\bI_g&{\bar\bD}}\right]\left[\matrix{\bA_g\bb_g-{\bar\bD}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}\cr\tilde{\bD}^{+}\tilde{\bb}}\right]\right\}\\

&=&
\mbox{sign}\left\{\bG_g\left[\matrix{\bI_g&-{\bar\bD}\tilde{\bD}^{+}\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}^{+}}\right]\bar\bb\right\}
\end{array}\label{bb1_g}
\end{equation}


\noindent On the other hand, with (\ref{B_asynch}), we know that

\begin{equation}
\bB\left[\bE_g\
\matrix{-{\bar\bD}\tilde{\bD}^+\cr\tilde{\bD}^+}\right]\bB
=\left[\matrix{\bI_g&{\bar\bD}\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}}\right]\left[\matrix{\bI_g&-{\bar\bD}\tilde{\bD}^+\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}^+}\right]\left[\matrix{\bI_g&{\bar\bD}\cr\bzero&\tilde{\bD}}\right]
=\bB\ . \label{psedoB1_g}
\end{equation}

\noindent So, the Moore-Penrose Matrix inverse $\bB^{+}$ of $\bB$
can be written by

\begin{equation}

\section{Performance Analysis}

Prior to developing the blind decorrelating detector, we will
discuss general decorrelating detectors in a subspace framework.
With (\ref{r}), the classic decorrelating detector performs the
following operation.

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat\bb&=&\mbox{sign}\{\bW_{\rm DD}^{\rm T}\br\}\\
 &=&\mbox{sign}\{\bS^+\br\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\bW^{\rm DD}$ is the linear filter representation
of the decorrelating detector bank, $[\star]^T$ denotes the
transpose of the matrix $\star$ and the $K\times L$ matrix $\bS^+$
is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of $\bS$.
In~\cite{Elda02}, it is shown that the above decorrelating
detector is the \em oblique projection\rm\ of the desired user's
signature vector onto the space spanned by other users' signature
vectors along the complement space of this space. This can be
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{DD_geometric}.

\begin{figure}
\center{
\includegraphics[width=3in]{DD_geometric.eps}
\caption{ The geometric interpretation of decorrelating detector.}
}\label{DD_geometric}
\end{figure}


The decorrelating detector is designed to completely eliminate MAI
caused by other users, at the expense of enhancing the ambient
noise. So, when the received amplitudes are completely unknown the
decorrelating detector is a sensible choice. There are some
desirable features of this multiuser detector. It does not require
knowledge of the received amplitude, but it requires $\bS^+$. It
can readily be decentralized in the sense that the demodulation of
each user can be implemented completely independently.
