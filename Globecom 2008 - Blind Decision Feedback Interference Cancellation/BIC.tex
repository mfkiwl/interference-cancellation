\begin{abstract}\small
Interference cancellation (IC) is one of the multiuser detection
(MUD) strategies for suppressing multiple access interference
(MAI) effects and consequently improving the system performance.
In this paper, a blind decision feedback interference cancellation (DF-IC) framework and
also two classes of blind interference cancellers based on least-square (LS)
and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criteria are proposed for
solving the near-far problem in synchronous CDMA. Compared
with existing blind multiuser detectors, the proposed detectors
require a minimum number of previously received signals and no
subspace separation or channel/sequence estimation operation.
Therefore the computation complexity can be much low and
detection delay is much reduced too. Theoretical analysis and
computer simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance
of the proposed schemes. All these can easily be extended for
asynchronous CDMA.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Compensating for near-far effects is critical for satisfactory
performance of code division multiple access (CDMA) systems.
Interference
cancellation~\cite{Yoon93,Patel94,Wijk95,Divsalar96,Kim98,Bugallo01}
provides a promising alternative to the conventional or optimum
detectors in multiuser detection since they typically require less
implementation complexity while practically offering similar
performance. The idea behind interference cancellation is to form
an estimate of the multiple access and/or multipath induced
interference and then subtract the interference estimate from the
received signal. Hence, compared to most multiuser detection
schemes, interference cancellation pays more attention to
interference estimation and different schemes for the MAI
estimation lead to different interference cancellation schemes.
The main alternatives for implementation of IC are parallel hard
interference cancellation (PIC)~\cite{Divsalar96,Kim98} and
serial/successive hard interference cancellation
(SIC)~\cite{Patel94,Wijk95}, while many other variants on these
basic principles have also been developed. Actually, an IC
detector will cancel the interfering signal exactly provided that
the decision was correct and channel information is known.
Otherwise, it may increase the contribution of the interferers.

Recent research has been devoted to blind interference
cancellation, as well as multiuser detection, and subspace-based
signature waveform estimation schemes for achieving better
performance and higher
capacity~\cite{Madh94,Honi95,Torl97,Wang98,Wang99,Zhang02}. Blind
interference cancellation can achieve good performance with only
the knowledge of the timing and signature waveform of desired
user(s). This assumption also is much closer to practical
applications. There are two popular approaches for designing blind
multiuser detectors. One is to use the conventional multiuser
signal model~\cite{Verd98,Madh94,Honi95,Zhang02} and the other
approach is based on parametric signal modelling and signal
spectrum estimation~\cite{Wang98,Wang99}. One of the major
difficulties in designing blind multiuser detector or interference
cancellor is receivers have no enough spreading signature
information for received signals, which make it difficult to
estimate the desired users' bits directly. One of the typical
approaches for solving this problem is to do blind sequence or
receiver filter estimation using statistical signal processing
techniques including subspace-based techniques.

In order to solve the near-far problem with minimum prior
knowledge and computation complexity, we take an alternative
framework for blind interference cancellation. We firstly
introduced a blind signal model and represent received signal
vectors in new fashion. We then separate interference from
received signals using Gauss-Seidel transformation, estimate the
MAI and do interference cancellation. This blind signal model is
different from the traditional linear prediction
model~\cite{Haykin96} and the widely-discussed conventional signal
model and subspace-based parametric signal model. In the proposed
model, each received signal can be taken as a linear combination
of desired users' spreading sequences, several previously received
signals and/or noise. Based on this new blind multiuser signal
model, several blind interference cancellation schemes are
developed using LS and MMSE criteria for interference estimation.
The proposed algorithms are simple and direct only using the
signatures and timing of desired users. There is no converging,
estimation or subspace separation procedure employed by many other
blind detectors~\cite{Madh94,Honi95,Wang98,Wang99}. Compared with
existing blind detection schemes, they require a minimum number of
previously received signals. Hence the computation complexity and
detection delay can be much reduced. Theoretical analysis and
computer simulations are finally presented to demonstrate the
performance of these blind detectors. The same framework and
approaches can be easily applied for asynchronous CDMA systems.
\section{System Model And Problem Description}
We consider forward-link transmissions in a single-cell DS/CDMA
system. There are $K$ active users over the multipath channel with
$P$ strong paths~\footnote{Strong paths are those to be explicitly
combined by RAKE receiver.} and the channel is an additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The baseband representation of the
received signal due to user $k$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r_k(t)&=&\sum\limits_{p=1}^{P}\alpha_{pk}A_k[n]
b_k[n]c_k(t-nT-\tau_p)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\alpha_{pk}$ is the $p$th path loss of user $k$'s
signal, $b_k{[n]}$ is the $n$th bit sent by user $k$. We assume
that the $\left\{b_k{[n]}\right\}$ are independent and identically
distributed random variables with $E\left\{b_k{[i]}\right\}=0$ and
$E\left\{|b_k{[i]}|^2\right\}=1$. The parameters $c_k(t)$ denote
the normalized spreading signal waveform of user $k$ during the
interval $[0,\ T]$, $\tau_1\leq\tau_2\leq\ldots\leq\tau_P$,
denotes $P$ different transmission delays from the base station to
user $k$ and $A_k[n]$ is the amplitude of the received signal for
user $k$ at time $t=n$. The total baseband signal received by user
$k$ is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\tilde{r}(t)&=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}r_k(t)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
The received signal $\tilde{r}(t)$ is passed through the
corresponding chip matched filter (CMF) $\phi(t)$ and RAKE
combiner. The combined output $r(t)$ is~\footnote{Without loss of
the generality, we drop the time index $n$ in the following
discussion.}
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
r(t)&=&A_k b_k c_k(t-nT-\tau_1)\otimes \phi(t-\tau_1)+ \\
&&\hspace{0.0in} m_{\rm ISI}(t) + m_{\rm MAI}(t) + n(t)
\end{array}\label{r_t}
\end{equation}
\noindent where
\begin{equation} \hspace{-0.05in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
 m_{\rm ISI}(t)&=&\\
 &&\hspace{-0.83in}\sum\limits^{P}_{p\neq
q}\beta_{qk} \alpha_{pk}A_kb_kc_k(t-nT+\tau_{q1}-\tau_1)\otimes
\phi(t-\tau_1)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent is the intersymbol interference (ISI) to user $k$,
\begin{equation} \hspace{-0.17in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
m_{\rm MAI}(t)&=&\sum\limits_{i\neq
 k}^{K}A_ib_ic_i(t-nT-\tau_1)\otimes\phi(t-\tau_1)+\\
 &&\hspace{-0.75in}\sum\limits_{i\neq
 k}^{K}\sum\limits^{P}_{p\neq
q}\beta_{qk}
\alpha_{pi}A_ib_ic_i(t-nT+\tau_{q1}-\tau_p)\otimes\phi(t-\tau_1)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent is the MAI to user $k$, $\beta_{qk}$ is the weight of
the $q$th RAKE finger with
$\sum\limits_{q=1}^{P}\beta_{qk}\alpha_{qk}=1$ and $\tau_{q1} =
\tau_{q}-\tau_1$ is the propagation delay difference between the
$1$st path and $p$th path. $\otimes$ denotes the convolutional
product. $n(t)$ is AWGN with variance $\sigma^2$. The user $k$'s
RAKE output can be sampled at $f_s=1/T_s$ and straightforwardly
expressed by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.1in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br&=&\left[
\matrix{r(nT+T_s+\tau_1)&\ldots&r(nT+LT_s+\tau_1)}\right]^{\rm
T}\\
 &=&\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} A_k b_k \bs_k + \bn \\
 &=&\bS \bA \bb + \bn
\end{array}\label{r_sync}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bS=[\bs_1\ \bs_2\ \ldots\ \bs_K]$ is the
received spreading sequence matrix combined with both ISI and MAI
information, and $L=T/T_s$ is the number of samples per symbol,
which should not be less than the spreading gain $L_c$.

Because of $m_{\rm MAI}(t)$ existing in the received signal
$r(t)$, the performance of conventional matched filter receiver
suffers from the so-called near-far problem~\cite{Verd98}.
Multiuser detection is the receiver technique for solving this
problem and most multiuser detectors are firstly developed using
the conventional system model like (\ref{r_sync}). These are well
documented in~\cite{Verd98}. One of the difficulties in developing
blind multiuser detectors using (\ref{r_sync}) is that the $\bS$
is hard to be known beforehand. And it normally takes much effort
to determine it later. The similar situation can also be met in
developing blind detectors using the parametric subspace signal
model proposed in~\cite{Wang98}.

\section{Blind Interference Cancellation}

In order to blindly estimate MAI without the original spreading
matrix $\bS$, we use a new blind but "faked" spreading matrix
$\bcS$ instead. We call it the blind but "faked" spreading matrix
because 1) it is composed by only desired users' spreading
sequences and previously received signals and 2) it isn't the
original one but will work like the original one. Without loss of
the generality, only the bits sent for first $G$ users are
considered here and the $L\times M$ blind spreading sequence
matrix $\bcS$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bcS&=&\left[\matrix{\bcS_1&\bcS_2}\right]\\
&=&\left[\matrix{\bs_1&\ldots&\bs_G&{\br}_{1}&{\br}_{2}&\ldots&{\br}_{M-G}}\right]
\end{array} \label{S_0}
\end{equation}
\noindent where
$\bcS_1=\left[\matrix{\bs_1&\bs_2&\ldots&\bs_G}\right]$ and
$\bs_g$, $g=1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ G$, denote the group of $G$ known
spreading waveforms to user $1$.
$\bcS_2=\left[\matrix{\br_1&\br_2&\ldots&\br_{M-G}}\right]$ and
${\br}_m$, $m=1,\ 2,\ \ldots,\ M-G$, are $M-G$ previously received
independent signal vectors~\footnote{The first $M-G$ received
signal $\br_m$ may be obtained from some receiver initialization
procedure. After that, there will be some possible adaptive
procedure for updating $\bcS$, e.g. the procedure proposed in
Section \ref{updatingG}. Compared with existing blind detectors,
this number, $M-G$, of required previously received signals are
very small.}. $K\leq M\leq L$. Obviously $M=K$ is the minimum
number for blind multiuser detector to unambiguously distinguish
different interfering signals. And if $M>L$, blind multiuser
receiver will not be unique since there will be more variables
than available equations. The relationship between the proposed
blind spreading matrix $\bcS$ and the original spreading matrix
$\bS$ can be given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bcS &=&\bS\bB + {\bN}\\
\end{array}\label{S_1}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the first $G$ columns of $\bcS$ and $\bS$ are
same,
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.0in}
\begin{array}{c}
 \bB=\left[\matrix{\bI_L & \bar\bD\cr\bzero&\tilde\bD }\right]=\left[\matrix{\bE & \matrix{\bar\bD\cr \tilde{\bD}} }\right]
  =\left[\matrix{\bG \cr \matrix{\mathbf{0}& \tilde{\bD}}
 }\right]
\end{array}\label{B}
\end{equation}
\noindent is the $K\times M$ data matrix associated with $\bcS$.
$\bE=[\matrix{\bI_L&\bzero}]^{\rm T}$, $\bG = \left[\matrix{\bI_L&
\bar\bD}\right]$ is the $G\times M$ matrix composed by known data
in $\bcS$. $\mbox{rank}\{\tilde{\bD}\}=K-G$ and
$\mbox{rank}\{\bB\}\leq K$.

After the blind spreading matrix $\bcS$ is defined, the received
signal vector $\br$ in (\ref{r_sync}) can be expressed as the
linear combination of the columns in $\bcS$ instead of $\bS$ by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\br&=&\bcS\bbf + \bar{\bn}\label{r_blind}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the $M \times 1$ vector $\bbf$ is termed the
detection vector defined by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\bbf&=&\left[\matrix{\bbf_1\cr\bbf_2}\right]&=&\bB^{+}\bar\bb
\end{array} \label{DetectorVector}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bbf_1$ is the subvector of $\bbf$ consisting of
the first $G$ elements of, $\bbf_2$ consists of the rest $M-G$
elements, $[\cdot]^{+} $ denotes the general inverse operator and
$\bar\bb=\bA \bb$. $\bar{\bn}$ is the new $L\times 1$ noise vector
defined by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\bn}&=&\bn-{\bN}\bB^{+}\bar\bb
\end{array}. \label{new_noise}
\end{equation}
\noindent Meanwhile, the MAI part of $\br$ can be written by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\bm&=&\bS_2\bA_2\bb_2 &=&\left(\bcS_2-\bcS_1\bar\bD\right)\bbf_2
\end{array}\label{bm}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bS_2$, $\bA_2$ and $\bb_2$ denote the original
spreading sequences, amplitudes and information bits for
interfering users. In order to separate MAI from received signal
for estimating $\bbf_2$, we perform QR-decomposition on $\bS_1$ by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bS_1&=&\bQ_1\bR_1
\end{array},
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bQ_1\in\mathbb{R}^{L\times L}$ is orthogonal and
$\bR_1=[\bR_{11}^{\rm H}\ \bzero^{\rm H}]^{\rm
H}\in\mathbb{R}^{L\times G}$, and apply $\bQ_1^{\rm H}$ on both
sides of (\ref{r_sync}) and (\ref{r_blind}). We then get
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bQ_{1}^{\rm
H}\br&=&\left[\matrix{\bR_{11}\bA_1\bb_1\cr\bzero}\right]+\left[\matrix{\bR_{12}\bA_2\bb_2\cr\bR_{22}\bA_2\bb_2}\right]+\bQ_1^{\rm
H}\bn\\
&=&\left[\matrix{\bcR_{11}\bbf_1\cr\bzero}\right]+\left[\matrix{\bcR_{12}\bbf_2\cr\bcR_{22}\bbf_2}\right]+\bQ_1^{\rm
H}\bar\bn
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the matrices $\bR_{11}$, $\bR_{12}$ and $\bR_{22}$
are given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bQ_{1}^{\rm
H}\bS&=&\left[\matrix{\bR_{11}&\bR_{12}\cr\bzero&\bR_{22}}\right]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent and the matrices $\bcR_{11}$, $\bcR_{12}$ and
$\bcR_{22}$ are given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bQ_{1}^{\rm
H}\bcS&=&\left[\matrix{\bcR_{11}&\bcR_{12}\cr\bzero&\bcR_{22}}\right]
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
Now we can see that $\bbf_2$ can be estimated with solving
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.05in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bT\bQ_{1}^{\rm H}\br&=&\bcR_{22}\bbf_2+\bT\bQ_1^{\rm H}\bar\bn
\end{array},\label{f2}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\bT=\left[\matrix{\bzero&\bI_{L-G}}\right]$ is
termed truncating matrix.

\noindent After $\bbf_2$ is estimated, the MAI $\bm$ can be
estimation using (\ref{bm}) and cancelled so that $\bb_1$ can be
detected with solving
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_1=\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bb_1}\left\|\bS_1\bA_1\bb_1-\left[\br-\left(\bcS_2-\bcS_1\bar\bD\right)\hat{\bbf}_2\right]\right\|_2^2
\end{array}\label{br_bm}
\end{equation}
\noindent or
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_1=\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bb_1}\mbox{E}\left\|\bS_1\bA_1\bb_1-\left[\br-\left(\bcS_2-\bcS_1\bar\bD\right)\hat{\bbf}_2\right]\right\|_2^2
\end{array}\label{br_bm}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Least Square IC}
In least square interference cancellation approaches, both the
interference $\bm$ and $\bb_1$ are estimated and detected with
least square criterion. After $\bbf_2$ is estimated, the
interference cancellation can be performed using
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.1in}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_1=\mbox{sgn}\left\{\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\by}\left\|\br-\left(\bcS_2-\bcS_1\bar\bD\right)\hat{\bbf}_2-\bS_1\bA_1\by\right\|_2\right\}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
There are typically two approaches for estimating $\bbf_2$ with
least square criterion. One is the classic least-square approach,
which can be expressed by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.10in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bbf}_2^{\rm
LS}&=&\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bx}\left\|\bT\bQ_{1}^{\rm
H}\br-\bcR_{22}\bx\right\|_2\\
&=&\bcR_{22}^{+}\bT\bQ_{1}^{\rm H}\br\ .
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent The LS-IC for the first $G$ users can then be written by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.02in}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_{1}^{\rm
LS}=\mbox{sgn}\left\{\bS_{1}^{+}\br-\bS_{1}^{+}\left(\bcS_{2}-\bcS_{1}\bar{\bD}\right)\bcR_{22}^{+}\bT\bQ_{1}^{\rm
H}\br\right\}
\end{array}\label{b_LS_IC}
\end{equation}
\noindent Another one is the total-least-square (TLS) approach,
which can be expressed by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.08in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\left[\matrix{\hat{\bcR}_{22}\cr\hat{\bbf}_2^{\rm
TLS}}\right]&=&\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bY\
\bx}\left\|\left[\matrix{\bcR_{22}\cr\bT\bQ_{1}^{\rm
H}\br}\right]-\left[\matrix{\bY\cr\bY\bx}\right]\right\|_2
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\noindent If $\sigma_{K-G}'>\sigma_{K-G+1}$, the TLS estimation of
$\bbf_2$ is
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.070in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf_2^{\rm TLS}}&=&\left(\bcR_{22}^{\rm
H}\bcR_{22}-\sigma_{K-G+1}^{2}\bI\right)\bcR_{22}^{\rm
H}\bT\bQ_{1}^{\rm H}\br
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\sigma_{K-G}'$ and $\sigma_{K-G+1}$ are the
$(K-G)$th and $(K-G+1)$th largest singular value of $\bcR_{22}$
and $\left[\matrix{\bT\bQ_{1}^{\rm H}\br&\bcR_{22}}\right]$. And
the TLS-IC can be expressed by
\begin{equation}\hspace{0.0in}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_{1}^{\rm
TLS}=\mbox{sgn}\left\{\bS_{1}^{+}\br-\bS_{1}^{+}\left({\bcS}_{2}-{\bcS}_{1}{\bar{\bD}}\right){\bbf_2^{\rm
TLS}}\right\}
\end{array}\label{b_TLS_IC}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Minimum Mean-Square Error IC}
In MMSE-based approach,the interference cancellation is done with
solving
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.1in}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_1=\mbox{sgn}\left\{\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\by}\mbox{E}\left\|\br-\left(\bcS_2-\bcS_1\bar\bD\right)\hat{\bbf}_2-\bS_1\bA_1\by\right\|_2\right\}\
,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent providing $\bbf_2$ is estimated. On the other hand,
$\bbf_2$ is estimated with minimizing MSE
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.08in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bbf}_2^{\rm
MMSE}&=&\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bx}\mbox{E}\left\|\bT\bQ_{1}^{\rm
H}\br-\bcR_{22}\bx\right\|_2^2\\
&=&\left(\bcR_{22}^{\rm
H}\bcR_{22}-\sigma^2\bI\right)^{-1}\bcR_{22}^{\rm
H}\bT\bQ_{1}^{\rm H}\br
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent so that the MMSE-IC can be written by
\begin{equation}\hspace{-0.10in}
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{\bb}_1=\mbox{sgn}\left\{\left(\bS_1\bA_1^2\bS_1^{\rm
H}-\sigma^2\bI\right)\bS_1^{\rm
H}\left(\br-\left(\bcS_2-\bcS_1\bar\bD\right)\hat{\bbf}_2\right)\right\}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}


\section{Performance Analysis}

\subsection{Relationship with Blind MUD}

It can be proven that the LS-IC in (\ref{b_LS_IC}) actually is
equal to a blind LS decorrelating detector
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_{1}&=&\mbox{sgn}\left\{\bG\bbf_{\rm LS}\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent with respect to
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm
LS}&=&\matrix{\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bx}\left\|\br-\bcS\bx\right\|_2}
\end{array}
\label{LSProb}
\end{equation}
\noindent and MMSE-IC is the same to the blind MMSE detector
\begin{equation}\hspace{0.0in}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{\bb}_1&=&\mbox{sgn}\left\{\bG\bbf_{\rm MMSE}\right\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent with respect to
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bbf}_{\rm
MMSE}&=&\mbox{arg}\min\limits_{\bx}E\left\{\left\|\bbf-\bx\right\|_2^2\right\}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{AME and Near-Far Resistance}
A commonly used performance measure for a multiuser detector is
asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME) and near-far
resistance~\cite{Verd98}. Since the proposed algorithms converges
to the conventional decorrelating detector as $\sigma^2\rightarrow
0$, their AME and near-far resistance are identical to the
decorrelating detector:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{\eta}_k&=&\frac{1}{\left[\bR^{+}\right]_{kk}}
\end{array}.
\end{equation}
\subsection{CRLB for $\bbf_2$ Estimation}
The Cram\'{e}r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is given by the inverse of
the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Providing the blind spreading
matrix $\bcS$ is known beforehand, we first define the parameter
vector $\mathbf{\phi} = \left[\bar{\sigma}^{2}\ \bbf_2^{\rm
H}\right]^{\rm H}$, where $\bar{\sigma}^{2}
=(1+\frac{M-G}{M-K})\sigma^{2}$, for computing the FIM
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\bI(\mathbf{\phi})} &=& {\rm E} \left\{ \left( \frac{\partial
\ln{\cal L}}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}} \right) \left( \frac{\partial
\ln{\cal L}}{\partial \mathbf{\phi}} \right)^{\rm H} \right\}
\label{fim}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\ln{\cal L}$ is the log-likelihood function given
by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\ln{\cal
L}&=&C-L\ln\bar{\sigma}^2-\frac{1}{2\bar{\sigma}^2}\parallel\mathbf{e}\parallel_2^2
\end{array},\label{logl}
\end{equation}
\noindent $C$ is a constant and
$\mathbf{e}=\bT\bQ_1\br-\bcR_{22}\bbf_2$. Providing $\bcS$ is
known, the closed-form CRLB expression of $\bbf_2$ is then given
by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
{\rm CRLB}(\bbf_2\ |\ \bcS) &
=&(1+\frac{M-G}{M-K})\sigma^{2}(\bcR_{22}^{\rm H}\bcR_{22})^{\rm
+}
\end{array}.\label{CRLB_f}
\end{equation}
\noindent It shows that the accuracy of estimating $\bbf_2$ may
increase with increasing $M$.

\section{Computer Simulations}
There are $K=10$ users with the group size $G=3$ and the spreading
sequences used in simulations are $64$-chip ($L=64$) random
sequences. In the computer simulations, the previous amplitude
estimation from (\ref{A_estimation}) is directly use for the next
detection without any amplitude filtering. From Subplot (a) in
Fig. 3, it is interesting to see that the performance of the
simplest LS detector has the best performance. From Subplot (b),
it is very impressive to find that the performance of blind LS
detector is very close to the conventional decorrelating detector
whatever how strong the MAI is in our simulations when $M$ is
large enough. We then check the performance of the proposed LS
blind detector against the amplitude estimation errors. From Fig.
4, we can see that the BER of the LS detector basically is
unchanged against amplitude estimation error when SNR is large
enough. From Fig. 5, we can see that the performance of the LS
detector can be better providing $M$ is larger enough. This
confirms (\ref{noise_var_new}), which shows that the variance of
$\bar{\bn}$ decrease with increasing $M$.

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we proposed a blind multiuser detection framework
as well as several blind detectors. The proposed blind detectors
are direct and simple without any channel or spreading sequence
estimation or subspace separation operation.
